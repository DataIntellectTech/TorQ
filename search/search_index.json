Given the unsurpassed data management and analytical capabilities of kdb+, the applicability of kdb+ technology extends beyond the financial domain into any sector where rapid pre-built or adhoc analysis of large datasets is required. Other sectors which have good use cases for kdb+ include utilities, pharmaceuticals, telecoms, manufacturing, retail and any sector utilising telemetry or sensor data. What is AquaQ TorQ? AquaQ TorQ is a framework which forms the basis of a production kdb+ system by implementing some core functionality and utilities on top of kdb+, allowing developers to concentrate on the application business logic. We have incorporated as many best practices as possible, with particular focus on performance, process management, diagnostic information, maintainability and extensibility. We have kept the code as readable as possible using descriptive comments, error messages, function names and variable names. Wherever possible, we have tried to avoid re-inventing the wheel and instead have used contributed code from code.kx.com (either directly or modified). All code sections taken from code.kx.com are referenced in this document. AquaQ TorQ can be extended or modified as required. We have chosen some default behaviour, but it can all be overridden. The features of AquaQ TorQ are: Process Management: Each process is given a type and name, and can optionally be given a parent type. By default these are used to determine the code base it loads, the configuration loaded, log file naming and how it reports itself to discovery services. Whenever possible we have tried to ensure that all default behaviour can be overridden at the process type level, and further at the process name level. Code Management: Processes can optionally load common or process type/name specific code bases. All code loading is error trapped. Configuration Management: Configuration scripts can be loaded as standard and with specific process type/name configuration overriding default values. Configuration scripts are loaded in a specific order; default, then parent process type specific (optional), process type specific, then process name specific. Values loaded last will override values loaded previously. Usage Logging: All process usage is logged to a single text log file and periodically rolled. Logging includes opening/closing of connections, synchronous and asynchronous queries and functions executed on the timer. Logged values include the request, the details of where it came from, the time it was received, the time it took, memory usage before and after, the size of the result set, the status and any error message. Incoming and Outgoing Connection Management: Incoming (client) and outgoing (server) connections are stored and their usage monitored through query counts and total data size counts. Connections are stored and retrieved and can be set to automatically be re-opened as required. The password used for outgoing connections can be overridden at default, parent process type (optional), process type and process name level. Access Controls: Basic access controls are provided, and could be extended. These apply restrictions on the IP addresses of remote connections, the users who can access the process, and the functions that each user can execute. A similar hierarchical approach is used for access control management as for configuration management. Timer Extensions: Mechanism to allow multiple functions to be added to the timer either on a repeating or one-off basis. Multiple re-scheduling algorithms supplied for repeating timers. Standard Out/Error Logging: Functions to print formatted messages to standard out and error. Hooks are provided to extend these as required, e.g. publication to centralised logging database. Standard out and error are redirected to appropriately named, timestamped and aliased log files, which are periodically rolled. Error Handling: Different failure options are supplied in case code fails to load; either exit upon failure, stop at the point of failure or trap and continue. Visualisation: Utilities to ease GUI development using websockets and HTML5. Documentation and Development Tools: Functionality to document the system is built into AquaQ TorQ, and can be accessed directly from every q session. Developers can extend the documentation as they add new functions. Functionality for searching for functions and variables by name and definition is provided, and for ordering variables by memory usage. The standard help.q from code.kx is also included. Utilities: We intend to build out and add utilities as we find them to be suitably useful and generic. So far we have: Caching: allows a result set cache to be declared and result sets to be stored and retrieved from the cache. Suitable for functions which may be run multiple times with the same parameters, with the underlying data not changing in a short time frame; Timezone Handling: derived from code.kx, allows conversion between timestamps in different timezones; Email: an library to send emails; Async Messaging: allows easy use of advanced async messaging methods such as deferred synchronous communication and async communication using postback functions; Heartbeating: each process can be set to publish heartbeats, and subscribe to and manage heartbeats from other processes in the environment; Data Loading: utility wrapper around .Q.fsn to read a data file from disk, manipulate it and write it out in chunks; Subscriptions: allow processes to dynamically detect and subscribe to datasources; Tickerplant Log File Recovery: recover as many messages as possible from corrupt log files; Database Writing: utility functions for writing to, sorting and parting on disk databases; Compression: allows compression of a database. This can be performed using a set of parameters for the entire database, but also gives the flexibilty of compressing user-specified tables and/or columns of those tables with different parameters if required, and also offers decompression. AquaQ TorQ will wrap easily around kdb+tick and therefore around any tickerplant, RDB, HDB or real time processing application. We currently have several customised processes of our own: Discovery Service: Every process has a type, name and set of available attributes, which are used by other processes to connect to it. The Discovery Service is a central point that can be used to find other available processes. Client processes can subscribe to updates from the discovery service as new processes become available- the discovery service will notify its subscribers, which can then use the supplied hook to implement required behavior e.g. connect to the newly available process; Gateway: A fully synchronous and asynchronous gateway is provided. The gateway will connect to a defined list of process types (can be homogenous or heterogeneous processes) and will route queries across them according to the priority of received requests. The routing algorithms can be easily modified e.g. give priority to user X, or only route queries to processes which exist in the same data centre or geographical region to avoid the WAN (this would entail using the process attributes). The gateway can either return the result to the client back down the same handle, or it can wrap it in a callback function to be invoked on the client; Real Time Database (RDB): A customized version of the kdb+tick RDB, to allow dynamic tickerplant subscriptions, reloading of multiple HDBs using authenticated connections, and customized end-of-day save downs. The RDB, WDB and tickerplant log replay share a common code base to ensure that a save-down modification to a table is applied across each of these processes. Write Database (WDB): The job of a WDB is to write data to disk rather than to serve client queries. WDBs usually write data out periodically throughout the day, and are useful when there is too much data to fit into memory and/or the end of day save operation needs to be speeded up. The concept is based on w.q Tickerplant Log Replay: A process for replaying tickerplant log files to create on-disk data sets. Extended features are provided for only replaying subsets of log files (by message number and/or table name), replaying in chunks, invoking bespoke final behaviour etc.; Reporter: The Reporter Process runs defined reports (q queries or parameterized functions) against specific database or gateways on a schedule. The results are retrieved and processed. Processing can be user defined, or can be a standard operation such as writing the data to disk, or emailing the results to a list of recipients. This can be useful for running system checks or generating management reports. Housekeeping: A process to undertake housekeeping tasks periodically, such as compressing and removing files that are no longer used. Housekeeping looks up a file of instructions and performs maintenance tasks on directories accordingly. Features allow selective file deletion and zipping according to file age, including a search string parameter and the ability to exclude items from the search. The process can be scheduled, or run immediately from the command line and can be extended as required to incorporate more tasks. File Alerter: A process to periodically scan a set of directories and execute a function based on the availability of a file. This is useful where files may arrive to the system during the day and must be acted upon (e.g. files are uploaded to a shared directory by users/clients). The functions to execute are defined by the user and the whole process is driven by a csv file detailing the file to search for, the function to execute and, optionally, a directory to move the file to after it has been processed. Monitor: A basic monitoring process which uses the Discovery Service to locate the other processes within the system, listens for heartbeats, and subscribes for log messages. This should be extended as required but provides a basic central point for system health checks; Kill: A process used to kill other processes, optionally using the Discovery Service to locate them. A Large Scale Data Processing Platform One of the key drivers behind TorQ development has been to ensure all the tools necessary to build a large scale data processing platform are available. kdb+tick provides the basic building blocks, and a standard set-up usually looks something like this: However, in reality it is usually more complicated. A larger scale architecture serving large numbers of client queries and receiving data from multiple sources may look like this: A common practice is to use a gateway (section gateway) to manage client queries across back-end processes. The gateway can load balance across processes and make failures transparent to the client. If the clients access the gateway with asynchronous calls, then the gateway can serve many requests at once and additionally implement client queuing algorithms. Other common production features include: A modified version of the RDB (section sec:rdb) which does different operations at end-of-day, reloads multiple HDB processes etc. A Write Database (section [sec:wdb]) which receives data from the tickerplant and periodically writes it to disk. WDBs are used when there is too much data in a day to fit into memory and/or to speed up the end-of-day rollover job Processes that load data from other sources either into the HDB directly or to the RDB potentially via the tickerplant (section [sec:dataloader]). The data may be dropped in specific locations which have to be monitored (section [sec:filealerter]) A Reporting Engine (section [sec:reporter]) to run periodic reports and do something with the result (e.g. generate an xls file from the database and email it to senior management). Reporting engines can also be used to run periodic checks of the system A Discovery Service (section [sec:discovery]) to allow processes to locate each other, and to allow processes to dynamically register availability and push notifications around the system. Basic Monitoring (section [sec:monitor]) of process availability Housekeeping (section [sec:housekeeping]) to ensure log files are tidied up, tickerplant log files are compressed/moved in a timely fashion etc. Do I Really Have to Read This Whole Document? Hopefully not. The core of AquaQ TorQ is a script called torq.q and we have tried to make it as descriptive as possible, so perhaps that will suffice. The first place to look will be in the config files, the main one being \\$KDBCONFIG/settings/default.q. This should contain a lot of information on what can be modified. There is also a cheatsheet contained within the documentation.

Suitable for functions which may be run multiple times with the same parameters, with the underlying data not changing in a short time frame; Timezone Handling: derived from code.kx, allows conversion between timestamps in different timezones; Email: an library to send emails; Async Messaging: allows easy use of advanced async messaging methods such as deferred synchronous communication and async communication using postback functions; Heartbeating: each process can be set to publish heartbeats, and subscribe to and manage heartbeats from other processes in the environment; Data Loading: utility wrapper around .Q.fsn to read a data file from disk, manipulate it and write it out in chunks; Subscriptions: allow processes to dynamically detect and subscribe to datasources; Tickerplant Log File Recovery: recover as many messages as possible from corrupt log files; Database Writing: utility functions for writing to, sorting and parting on disk databases; Compression: allows compression of a database. This can be performed using a set of parameters for the entire database, but also gives the flexibilty of compressing user-specified tables and/or columns of those tables with different parameters if required, and also offers decompression. AquaQ TorQ will wrap easily around kdb+tick and therefore around any tickerplant, RDB, HDB or real time processing application. We currently have several customised processes of our own: Discovery Service: Every process has a type, name and set of available attributes, which are used by other processes to connect to it. The Discovery Service is a central point that can be used to find other available processes. Client processes can subscribe to updates from the discovery service as new processes become available- the discovery service will notify its subscribers, which can then use the supplied hook to implement required behavior e.g. connect to the newly available process; Gateway: A fully synchronous and asynchronous gateway is provided. The gateway will connect to a defined list of process types (can be homogenous or heterogeneous processes) and will route queries across them according to the priority of received requests. The routing algorithms can be easily modified e.g. give priority to user X, or only route queries to processes which exist in the same data centre or geographical region to avoid the WAN (this would entail using the process attributes). The gateway can either return the result to the client back down the same handle, or it can wrap it in a callback function to be invoked on the client; Real Time Database (RDB): A customized version of the kdb+tick RDB, to allow dynamic tickerplant subscriptions, reloading of multiple HDBs using authenticated connections, and customized end-of-day save downs. The RDB, WDB and tickerplant log replay share a common code base to ensure that a save-down modification to a table is applied across each of these processes. Write Database (WDB): The job of a WDB is to write data to disk rather than to serve client queries. WDBs usually write data out periodically throughout the day, and are useful when there is too much data to fit into memory and/or the end of day save operation needs to be speeded up. The concept is based on w.q Tickerplant Log Replay: A process for replaying tickerplant log files to create on-disk data sets. Extended features are provided for only replaying subsets of log files (by message number and/or table name), replaying in chunks, invoking bespoke final behaviour etc.; Reporter: The Reporter Process runs defined reports (q queries or parameterized functions) against specific database or gateways on a schedule. The results are retrieved and processed. Processing can be user defined, or can be a standard operation such as writing the data to disk, or emailing the results to a list of recipients. This can be useful for running system checks or generating management reports. Housekeeping: A process to undertake housekeeping tasks periodically, such as compressing and removing files that are no longer used. Housekeeping looks up a file of instructions and performs maintenance tasks on directories accordingly. Features allow selective file deletion and zipping according to file age, including a search string parameter and the ability to exclude items from the search. The process can be scheduled, or run immediately from the command line and can be extended as required to incorporate more tasks. File Alerter: A process to periodically scan a set of directories and execute a function based on the availability of a file. This is useful where files may arrive to the system during the day and must be acted upon (e.g. files are uploaded to a shared directory by users/clients). The functions to execute are defined by the user and the whole process is driven by a csv file detailing the file to search for, the function to execute and, optionally, a directory to move the file to after it has been processed. Monitor: A basic monitoring process which uses the Discovery Service to locate the other processes within the system, listens for heartbeats, and subscribes for log messages. This should be extended as required but provides a basic central point for system health checks; Kill: A process used to kill other processes, optionally using the Discovery Service to locate them.","title":"What is AquaQ TorQ?"},{"location":"Overview/#a-large-scale-data-processing-platform","text":"One of the key drivers behind TorQ development has been to ensure all the tools necessary to build a large scale data processing platform are available. kdb+tick provides the basic building blocks, and a standard set-up usually looks something like this: However, in reality it is usually more complicated. A larger scale architecture serving large numbers of client queries and receiving data from multiple sources may look like this: A common practice is to use a gateway (section gateway) to manage client queries across back-end processes. The gateway can load balance across processes and make failures transparent to the client. If the clients access the gateway with asynchronous calls, then the gateway can serve many requests at once and additionally implement client queuing algorithms. Other common production features include: A modified version of the RDB (section sec:rdb) which does different operations at end-of-day, reloads multiple HDB processes etc. A Write Database (section [sec:wdb]) which receives data from the tickerplant and periodically writes it to disk. WDBs are used when there is too much data in a day to fit into memory and/or to speed up the end-of-day rollover job Processes that load data from other sources either into the HDB directly or to the RDB potentially via the tickerplant (section [sec:dataloader]). The data may be dropped in specific locations which have to be monitored (section [sec:filealerter]) A Reporting Engine (section [sec:reporter]) to run periodic reports and do something with the result (e.g. generate an xls file from the database and email it to senior management).

The discovery service does not manage connections- it simply returns tables of registered processes, irrespective of their current availability. It is up to each individual process to manage its own connections. The discovery service uses the process.csv file to make connections to processes on start up. After start up it is up to each individual process to attempt connections and register with the discovery service. This is done automatically, depending on the configuration parameters. Multiple discovery services can be run in which case each process will try to register and retrieve process details from each discovery process it finds in its process.csv file. Discovery services do not replicate between themselves. A discovery process must have its process type listed as discovery. To run the discovery service, use a start line such as: aquaq $ q torq.q -load code/processes/discovery.q -p 9995 -proctype discovery -procname discovery1 Modify the configuration as required. Operation Processes register with the discovery service. Processes use the discovery service to locate other processes. When new services register, any processes which have registered an interest in that process type are notified.

The gateway can be used for load balancing and/or to join the results of queries across heterogeneous servers (e.g. an RDB and HDB). Ideally the gateway should only be used with asynchronous calls. Prior to KDB v3.6, synchronous calls caused the gateway to block which limits the gateway to serving one query at a time (although if querying across multiple backend servers the backend queries will be run in parallel). For v3.6+, deferred synchronous requests to the gateway are supported. This allows the gateway to process multiple synchronous requests at once, therefore removing the requirement for the gateway to allow only one type of request. When using asynchronous calls, the client can either block and wait for the result (deferred synchronous) or post a call back function which the gateway will call back to the client with. The backend servers to be queried against with asynchronous and synchronous queries are selected using process type. The gateway API can be seen by querying .api.p\u201c.gw.*\u201d within a gateway process. Asynchronous Behaviour Asynchronous queries allow much greater flexibility. They allow multiple queries to be serviced at once, prioritisation, and queries to be timed out. When an asynchronous query is received the following happens: the query is placed in a queue; the list of available servers is retrieved; the queue is prioritised, so those queries with higher priority are serviced first; queries are sent to back end servers as they become available. Once the backend server returns its result, it is given another query; when all the partial results from the query are returned the results are aggregated and returned to the client. They are either returned directly, or wrapped in a callback and posted back asynchronously to the client. The two main customisable features of the gateway are the selection of available servers (.gw.availableservers) and the queue prioritisation (.gw.getnextqueryid). With default configuration, the available servers are those servers which are not currently servicing a query from the gateway, and the queue priority is a simple FIFO queue. The available servers could be extended to handle process attributes, such as the available datasets or the location of the process, and the queue prioritisation could be modified to anything required e.g. based on the query itself, the username, host of the client etc. An asynchronous query can be timed out using a timeout defined by the client. The gateway will periodically check if any client queries have not completed in the alotted time, and return a timeout error to the client. If the query is already running on any backend servers then they cannot be timed out other than by using the standard -T flag. Synchronous Behaviour Prior to KDB v3.6, when using synchronous queries the gateway could only handle one query at a time and cannot timeout queries other than with the standard -T flag. The variable .gw.synccallsallowed is by default set to 0b prior to KDB v3.6. To send synchronous calls, edit the gateway.q file so that .gw.synccallsallowed is set to true. (The exception being with TorQ-FSP, in which case it is set to 1b by default.) For v3.6+, deferred synchronous calls are supported, allowing the gateway to process multiple requests at a time. All synchronous queries will be immediately dispatched to the back end processes. They will be dispatched using an asynchronous call, allowing them to run in parallel rather than serially. When the results are received they are aggregated and returned to the client. Process Discovery The gateway uses the discovery service to locate processes to query across. The discovery service will notify the gateway when new processes become available and the gateway will automatically connect and start using them. The gateway can also use the static information in process.csv, but this limits the gateway to a predefined list of processes rather than allowing new services to come online as demand requires. Error Handling All errors and results can now be formatted with the formatresult function. Each response to the client is passed through this function with inputs status (1b=result,0b=error), sync (1b=sync,0b=async) and result (result/error) to allow different errors/results to be handled appropriately. As default, when synchronous calls are used, q errors are returned to clients as they are encountered. When using asynchronous calls, appropriately prefixed strings are used. It is up to the client to check the type of the received result and if it is a string then whether it contains the error prefix. The error prefix can be changed, but the default is \u201cerror: \u201d. Alternatively, the formatresult function can be altered as necessary. Errors will be returned when: the client requests a query against a server type which the gateway does not currently have any active instances of (this error is returned immediately); the client requests a query with the wrong servertype types; the client requests a query with null servers; the query is timed out; a back end server returns an error; a back end server fails; the join function fails. If postback functions are used, the error string will be posted back within the postback function (i.e. it will be packed the same way as a valid result). Client Calls There are four main client calls. The .gw.sync* methods should only be invoked synchronously, and the .gw.async* methods should only be invoked asynchronously. Each of these are documented more extensively in the gateway api. Use .api.p\u201c.gw.*\u201d for more details. Function Description .gw.syncexec[query; servertypes] Execute the specified query synchronously against the required list of servers. If more than one server, the results will be razed. .gw.syncexecj[query; servertypes; joinfunction] Execute the specified query against the required list of servers. Use the specified join function to aggregate the results. .gw.asyncexec[query; servertypes] Execute the specified query against the required list of servers. If more than one server, the results will be razed. The client must block and wait for the results. .gw.asyncexecjpt[query; servertypes; joinfunction; postback; timeout] Execute the specified query against the required list of servers. Use the specified join function to aggregate the results. If the postback function is not set, the client must block and wait for the results. If it is set, the result will be wrapped in the specified postback function and returned asynchronously to the client. The query will be timed out if the timeout value is exceeded. Client Call Examples Here are some examples for using client calls via a handle to the gateway process. To reiterate, v3.6+ users can use synchronous calls, whilst asynchronous calls are only relevant for users on < v3.6.

The postback function must take two parameters- the first is the function that was sent up, the second is the results. The postback can either be a lambda, or the name of a function eg. handleresults. q)h:hopen 8000 q)handleresults:{-1(string .z.z),\" got results\"; -3!x; show y} //postback with timestamp, got results and an output of the results q)(neg h)(`.gw.asyncexecjpt;(`f;2);`hdb`rdb;raze;{-1(string .z.z),\" got results\"; -3!x; show y};0Wn) //[.gw.asyncexecjpt[query;servertypes(list of symbols);joinfunction(lambda);postbackfunction(lambda or symbol);timeout(timespan)] q) q) /- These q prompts are from pressing enter q) /- The q client is not blocked, unlike the previous example q) q)2014.01.07T16:53:42.481 got results a ---- 5014 5015 5016 5017 5018 5012 5013 5014 5015 5016 /- Can also use a named function rather than a lambda q)(neg h)(`.gw.asyncexecjpt;(`f;2);`hdb`rdb;raze;`handleresults;0Wn) q) q) q)2014.01.07T16:55:12.235 got results a ---- 5014 5015 5016 5017 5018 5012 5013 5014 5015 5016 Asynchronous queries can also be timed out. This query will run for 22 seconds, but should be timed out after 5 seconds. There is a tolerance of +5 seconds on the timeout value, as that is how often the query list is checked. This can be reduced as required. q)(neg h)(`.gw.asyncexecjpt;(`f;20);`hdb`rdb;raze;();0D00:00:05); r:h(::) q)q)q)r \"error: query has exceeded specified timeout value\" q)\\t (neg h)(`.gw.asyncexecjpt;(`f;20);`hdb`rdb;raze;();0D00:00:05); r:h(::) 6550 Non kdb+ Clients All the examples in the previous section are from clients written in q. However it should be possible to do most of the above from non kdb+ clients. The officially supported APIs for Java, C# and C allow the asynchronous methods above. For example, we can modify the try block in the main function of the Java Grid Viewer : import java.awt.BorderLayout; import java.awt.Color; import java.io.IOException; import java.lang.reflect.Array; import java.util.logging.Level; import java.util.logging.Logger; import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JScrollPane; import javax.swing.JTable; import javax.swing.table.AbstractTableModel; import kx.c; public class Main { public static class KxTableModel extends AbstractTableModel { private c.Flip flip; public void setFlip(c.Flip data) { this.flip = data; } public int getRowCount() { return Array.getLength(flip.y[0]); } public int getColumnCount() { return flip.y.length; } public Object getValueAt(int rowIndex, int columnIndex) { return c.at(flip.y[columnIndex], rowIndex); } public String getColumnName(int columnIndex) { return flip.x[columnIndex]; } }; public static void main(String[] args) { KxTableModel model = new KxTableModel(); c c = null; try { c = new c(\"localhost\", 8000,\"username:password\"); // Create the query to send String query=\".gw.asyncexec[(`f;2);`hdb`rdb]\"; // Send the query c.ks(query); // Block on the socket and wait for the result model.setFlip((c.Flip) c.k()); } catch (Exception ex) { Logger.getLogger(Main.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex); } finally { if (c != null) {try{c.close();} catch (IOException ex) {} } } JTable table = new JTable(model); table.setGridColor(Color.BLACK); String title = \"kdb+ Example - \"+model.getRowCount()+\" Rows\"; JFrame frame = new JFrame(title); frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); frame.getContentPane().add(new JScrollPane(table), BorderLayout.CENTER); frame.setSize(300, 300); frame.setVisible(true); } } Some of the unofficially supported APIs may only allow synchronous calls to be made. Tickerplant The tickerplant is a modified version of the standard kdb+tick tickerplant. The modifications from the standard tick.q include: Applies timestamps as timestamp rather than timespan; Tracks per table record counts in .u.icounts dictionary for faster recovery of real time subscribers; Allows configuration of timezones for timestamping data and performing end of day rollover (see eodtime.q ); The tickerplant log file will be written to hdb/database. Real Time Database (RDB) The Real Time Database is a modified version of r.q found in kdb+tick. The modifications from the standard r.q include: Tickerplant (data source) and HDB location derived from processes defined by the discovery service or from config file; Automatic re-connection and resubscription to tickerplant; List of tables to subscribe to supplied as configuration setting; More pre-built flexibility in end-of-day; More verbose end-of-day logging; Reload multiple authenticated HDBs after end-of-day; End-of-day save down manipulation code is shared between RDB, WDB and tickerplant log replay See the top of the file for more information. Write Database (WDB) The Write Database or WDB is based on w.q. This process features a number of modifications and enhancements over w.q: Provides the option to write down to a custom partition scheme, defined by parted columns in sort.csv, which removes the need for end of day sorting; Greater configuration options; max rows on a per table basis, list subscription tables, upd function etc. See the top of the process file for the options; Use of common code with the RDB and Tickerplant Log Replay process to manipulate tables before save, sort and apply attributes; Checks whether to persist data to disk on a timer rather than on each tick; Informs other RDB, HDB and GW processes that end of day save and sort has completed; More log information supplied; End of day timezone can be configured (see eodtime.q ). The WDB process can broken down into two main functions: Periodically saving data to disk and Sorting data at end of day The WDB process provides flexibility so it can be set-up as a stand-alone process that will both save and sort data or two separate processes (one that saves the data and another that will sort the data on disk). This allows greater flexibility around the end of day event as sorting data can be time consuming. It is also helps when implementing seemless rollovers (i.e. no outage window at end-of-day). The behaviour of the WDB process is controlled by the .wdb.mode parameter. This should be set to one of following three values: saveandsort - the process will subscribe for data, periodically write data to disk and at EOD it will flush remaining data to disk before sorting it and informing GWs, RDBs and HDBs etc. save - the process will subscribe for data, periodically write data to disk and at EOD it will flush remaining data to disk. It will then inform its respective sort mode process to sort the data sort - the process will wait to get a trigger from its respective save mode process. When this is triggered it will sort the data on disk, apply attributes and the trigger a reload on the RDB, HDB and GW processes When running a system with separate save and sort process, the sort process should be configured in the processes.csv file with a proctype of sort. The save process will check for processes with a proctype of sort when it attempts to trigger the end of day sort of the data. The wdb process provides two methods for persisting data to disk and sorting at the end of the day. default - Data is persisted into a partition defined by the [partitiontype] variable, similar to the hdb partition scheme. The general scheme is of the form [wdbdir]/[partitiontype]/[table]/. And a typical partition directory would be similar to wdb/database/2015.11.26/trades/. At the end of the day, before being moved to the hdb, the data is sorted according to parameters defined in sort.csv. For each table, sort.csv will specify the columns to sort (using xasc) and apply attributes to. partbyattr - Data is persisted to a custom partition scheme, derived from parameters in the sort.csv file. The write down scheme is taken from sort.csv, to reflect the effect of using xasc at the end of day. For each table, the columns defined in sort.csv, with the parted attribute, are used to create custom partitions in the wdb. Multiple columns can be defined with the parted attribute and distinct combinations of each are generated for custom partitions. The general partition scheme is of the form [wdbdir]/[partitiontype]/[table]/[parted column(s)]/. And a typical partition directory would be similar to wdb/database/2015.11.26/trade/MSFT_N. In the above example, the data is parted by sym and source, and so a unique partition directory MSFT_N is created in the wdb directory. At the end of the day, data is upserted into the hdb without the need for sorting. The number of rows that are joined at once is limited by the mergenumrows and mergenumtab parameters. The optional partbyattr method may provide a significant saving in time at the end of day, allowing the hdb to be accessed sooner. For large data sets with a low cardinality (ie. small number of distinct elements) the optional method may provide a significant time saving, upwards of 50%. The optional method should also reduce the memory usage at the end of day event, as joining data is generally less memory intensive than sorting. Tickerplant Log Replay The Tickerplant Log Replay script is for replaying tickerplant logs. This is useful for: handling end of day save down failures; handling large volumes of data (larger than can fit into RAM). The process takes as the main input either an individual log file to replay, or a directory containing a set of log files. Amongst other functionality, the process can: replay specific message ranges; replay in manageable message chunks; recover as many messages as possible from a log file rather than just stopping at the first bad message; ignore specific tables; modify the tables before or after they are saved; apply sorting and parting after all the data is written out. The process must have some variables set (the tickerplant log file or directory, the schema file, and the on-disk database directory to write to) or it will fail on startup. These can either be set in the config file, or overridden from the command line in the usual way. An example start line would be: q torq.q -debug -load code/processes/tickerlogreplay.q -p 9990 -.replay.tplogfile ../test/tplogs/marketdata2013.12.17 -.replay.schemafile ../test/marketdata.q -.replay.hdbdir ../test/hdb1 -proctype tickerlogreplay -procname tplogreplay1 The tickerplant log replay script has extended usage information which can be accessed with -.replay.usage. q torq.q -debug -load code/processes/tickerlogreplay.q -p 9990 -.replay.usage -proctype tickerlogreplay -procname tplogreplay1 Housekeeping The housekeeping process is used to undertake periodic system housekeeping and maintenance, such as compressing or removing files which are no longer required. The process will run the housekeeping jobs periodically on a timer. Amongst other functionality the process: Allows for removing and zipping of directory files; Provides an inbuilt search utility and selectively searches using a \u2018find\u2019 and \u2018exclude\u2019 string, and an \u2018older than\u2019 parameter; Reads all tasks from a single CSV; Runs on a user defined timer; Can be run immediately from command line or within the process; Can be easily extended to include new user defined housekeeping tasks. The process has two main parameters that should be set prior to use; runtimes and inputcsv.\u2018Runtimes\u2019 sets the timer to run housekeeping at the set time(s), and \u2018Inputcsv\u2019 provides the location of the housekeeping csv file. These can either be set in the config file, or overridden via the command line. If these are not set, then default parameters are used; 12.00 and \u2018KDBCONFIG/housekeeping.csv\u2019 respectively. The process is designed to run from a single csv file with five headings: Function details the action that you wish to be carried out on the files, initially, this can be rm (remove) and zip (zipping); Path specifies the directory that the files are in; Match provides the search string to the find function, files returned will have names that match this string; Exclude provides a second string to the find function, and these files are excluded from the match list; Age is the \u2018older than\u2019 parameter, and the function will only be carried out on files older than the age given (in days). An example csv file would be: function,path,match,exclude,age zip,./logs/,*.log,*tick*,2 rm,./logs/,*.log*,*tick*,4 zip,./logs/,*tick*,,1 rm,./logs/,*tick*,,3 function path match exclude age ---------------------------------------- zip \"./logs/\" \"*.log\" \"*tick*\" 2 rm \"./logs/\" \"*.log*\" \"*tick*\" 4 zip \"./logs/\" \"*tick*\" \"\" 1 rm \"./logs/\" \"*tick*\" \"\" 3 The process reads in the csv file, and passes it line by line to a \u2018find\u2019 function; providing a dictionary of values that can be used to locate the files required. The find function takes advantage of system commands to search for the files according to the specifications in the dictionary. A search is performed for both the match string and the exclude string, and cross referenced to produce a list of files that match the parameters given. The files are then each passed to a further set of system commands to perform the task of either zipping or removing. Note that an incomplete csv or non-existant path will throw an error. The remove and zipping functions form only basic implimentations of the housekeeping process; it is designed to be exended to include more actions than those provided. Any user function defined in the housekeeping code can be employed in the same fashion by providing the name of the function,search string and age of files to the csv. As well as being scheduled on a timer, the process can also be run immediately. Adding \u2018-hk.runnow 1\u2019 to the command line when starting the process will force immediate running of the actions in the housekeeping csv. Likewise, setting runnow to 1b in the config file will immediately run the cleaning process. Both methods will cause the process to exit upon completion. Calling hkrun[] from within the q process will also run the csv instructions immediately. This will not affect any timer scheduling and the process will remain open upon completion. Housekeeping works both on windows and unix based systems. Since the process utilizes inbuilt system commands to perform maintenances, a unix/windows switch detects the operating system of the host and applies either unix or widows functions appropriately. Extensions need only be made in the namespace of the hosting operating system (i.e. if you are using a unix system, and wish to add a new function, you do not need to add the function to the windows namespace to). Usage information can be accessed using the \u2018-hkusage\u2019 flag: q torq.q -load code/processes/housekeeping.q -p 9999 -proctype housekeeping -procname hk1 -debug -hkusage File Alerter The file alerter process is a long-running process which periodically scans a set of directories for user-specified files. If a matching file is found it will then carry out a user-defined function on it. The files to search for and the functions to run are read in from a csv file. Additionally, the file alerter process can: run more than one function on the specified file. optionally move the file to a new directory after running the function. store a table of files that have already been processed. run the function only on new files or run it every time the file is modified. ignore any matching files already on the system when the process starts and only run a function if a new file is added or a file is modified. The file alerter process has four parameters which should be set prior to use. These parameters can either be set in the config file or overridden on the command-line. If they are not set, the default parameters will be used. The parameters are as follows. inputcsv - The name and location of the csv file which defines the behaviour of the process. The default is KDBCONFIG/filealerter.csv. polltime - How often the process will scan for matching files. The default is 0D:00:01, i.e., every minute. alreadyprocessed - The name and location of the already-processed table. The default is KDBCONFIG/filealerterprocessed. This table will be created automatically the first time the process is ran. skipallonstart - If this is set to 1, it will ignore all files already on the system; if it is set to 0, it will not. The default value is 0. The files to find and the functions to run are read in from a csv file created by the user. This file has five columns, which are detailed below. path - This is the path to the directory that will be scanned for the file. match - This is a search string matching the name of the file to be found. Wildcards can be used in this search, for example, \u201cfile*\u201d will find all files starting with \u201cfil\u201d. function - This is the name of the function to be run on the file. This function must be defined in the script KDBCODE/processes/filealerter.q. If the function is not defined or fails to run, the process will throw an error and ignore that file from then on. newonly - This is a boolean value. If it is set to 1, it will only run the function on the file if it has been newly created. If it is set to 0, then it will run the function every time the file is modified. movetodirectory - This is the path of the directory you would like to move the file to after it has been processed. If this value is left blank, the file will not be moved. It is possible to run two separate functions on the same file by adding them as separate lines in the csv file. If the file is to be moved after it is processed, the file alerter will run both functions on the file and then attempt to move it. A typical csv file to configure the file alerter would look like: path,match,function,newonly,movetodirectory /path/to/dirA,fileA.*,copy,0,/path/to/newDir /path/to/dirB,fileB.txt,email,1, /path/to/dirA,fileA.*,delete,0,/path/to/newDir path match function newonly movetodirectory --------------------------------------------------- \"/path/to/dirA\" \"fileA.*\" copy 0 \"/path/to/newDir\" \"/path/to/dirB\" \"fileB.txt\" email 1 \"\" \"/path/to/dirA\" \"fileA.*\" delete 0 \"/path/to/newDir\" The file alerter process reads in each line of the csv file and searches files matching the search string specified in that line. Note that there may be more than one file found if a wildcard is used in the search string. If it finds any files, it will check that they are not in the already processed table. If newonly is set to 1, it only checks if the filename is already in the table. If newonly is set to 0, it checks against the filename, filesize and a md5 hash of the file. The md5 hash and the filesize are used to determine if the file has been modified since it was processed last. If the found files have not been processed already, it then attempts to run the specified function to these files. After the process has run through each line of the csv, it generates a table of all files that were processed on that run. These files are appended to the already processed table which is then saved to disk. The file alerter will attempt to move the files to the \u2018movetodirectory\u2019, if specified. If the file has already been moved during the process (for example, if the function to run on it was \u2018delete\u2019), the file alerter will not attempt to move it. The file alerter is designed to be extended by the user. Customised functions should be defined within the filealerter.q script. They should be diadic functions, i.e., they take two parameters: the path and the filename. As an example, a simple function to make a copy of a file in another directory could be: copy:{[path;file] system \"cp \", path,\"/\", file, \" /path/to/newDir\"} Although the process is designed to run at regular intervals throughout the day, it can be called manually by invoking the FArun[] command from within the q session. Similarly, if new lines are added to the csv file, then it can be re-loaded by calling the loadcsv[] command from the q session. Each stage of the process, along with any errors which may occur, are appropriately logged in the usual manner. The file alerter process is designed to work on both Windows and Unix based systems. Since many of the functions defined will use inbuilt system command they will be need to written to suit the operating system in use. It should also be noted that Windows does not have an inbuilt md5 hashing function so the file alerter will only detect different versions of files if the filename or filesize changes. Reporter Overview The reporter process is used to run periodic reports on specific processes. A report is the result of a query that is run on a process at a specific time. The result of the query is then handled by one of the inbuilt result handlers, with the ability to add custom result handlers. Features: Easily create a report for information that you want; Fully customizable scheduling such as start time, end time and days of the week; Run reports repeatedly with a custom period between them; Asynchronous querying with custom timeout intervals; Inbuilt result handlers allow reports to be written to file or published; Custom result handlers can be defined; Logs each step of the report process; Fully integrated with the TorQ gateway to allow reports to be run across backend processes. The reporter process has three parameters that are read in on initialisation from the reporter.q file found in the $KDBCONFIG/settings directory. These settings are the string filepath of the input csv file, a boolean to output log messages and timestamp for flushing the query log table. To run the reporter process: q torq.q -load code/processes/reporter.q -p 20004 -proctype reporter -procname reporter1 Once the reporter process has been initiated, the reports will be scheduled and no further input is required from the user. Report Configuration By default, the process takes its inputs from a file called reporter.csv which is found in the $KDBCONFIG directory. This allows the user complete control over the configuration of the reports. As the queries are evaluated on the target process, local variables can be referenced or foreign functions can be run. Table [table:reportertable] shows the meaning of the csv schema. Column Header Description and Example name Report name e.g. Usage query Query to be evaluated on that process. It can be a string query or function resulthandler Result handlers are run on the returned result. Custom result handlers can be added. The result handler must be a monadic function with the result data being passed in e.g. writetofile[\u201c./output\u201d;\u201cusage\u201d] gateway If non null the reporter will query processes route the query to the proctype specified in this field. The values in the proctype field will be the process types on which the gateway runs the backend query. e.g. `gateway joinfunction Used to join the results when a gateway query is being used. The choice of joinfunction must take into account the result that will be received. The function must be monadic and the parameter will be the list of results returned from the backend processes e.g. raze proctype The type of process that the report will be run on. If the gateway field is not empty this may be a list of process types, otherwise the reporter will throw an error on startup. e.g. `rdb procname The name of a specific process to run the report on. If left null, the reporter process will select a random process with the specified proctype. If the gateway field is not null, this field specifies the specific gateway process name to run the query against e.g. `hdb1 start Time on that day to start at e.g. 12:00 end Time on that day that the report will stop at e.g. 23:00 period The period between each report query e.g. 00:00:10 timeoutinterval The amount of time the reporter waits before timing out a report e.g. 00:00:30 daysofweek Numeric value required for the day of the week. Where 0 is Saturday and 2 is Monday When running a report on a gateway, the gateway field must be set to the proctype of the gateway that will be queried. It will then run the report on the processes which are listed in the proctype field and join the results by using the function specified in the joinfunction field. If there is no join function then the reporter process will not start. Multiple entries in the proctype field must be separated by a space and are only allowed when the gateway field is not empty. If gateway field is empty and there are multiple entries in the proctype field then the reporter process will not load. Listing [code:csvschema] shows an example of the schema needed in the input csv file. name|query|resulthandler|gateway|joinfunction|proctype|procname|start|end|period|timeoutinterval|daysofweek usage|10#.usage.usage|writetofiletype[\"./output/\";\"usage\";\"csv\"]|||rdb||00:01|23:50|00:01|00:00:01|0 1 2 3 4 5 6 memory|.Q.w[]|writetofile[\"./output/\";\"memory.csv\"]|||rdb|rdb1|00:05|18:00|00:01|00:00:08|0 1 2 3 4 5 6 usage_gateway|10#.usage.usage||gateway|raze|rdb hdb||00:02|22:00|00:01|00:00:10|0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Result Handlers There are several default result handlers which are listed below. Custom result handlers can be defined as required. The result handler will be invoked with a single parameter (the result of the query). writetofiletype - Accepts 3 parameters: path, filename, filetype and data. When writing to file it uses a date time suffix so the resultant filename will be usage_rdb_2014_01_02_15_00_12.txt e.g. writetofiletype[\"./output/\";\"usage\";\"csv\"] splaytable - This accepts 3 parameters: path, file and data. This splays the result to a directory. The result must be a table in order to use this function e.g. splaytable[\"./output/\";\"usage\"] emailalert - This accepts 3 parameters: period, recipient list and data. The period dictates the throttle i.e. emails will be sent at most every period. The result of the report must be a table with a single column called messages which contains the character list of the email message. This is used with the monitoring checks to raise alerts, but can be used with other functions. emailalert[0D00:30;(\"test@aquaq.co.uk\";\"test1@aquaq.co.uk\")] emailreport - This accepts 3 parameters: temporary path, recipient list, file name, file type and data. The data is written out as the file type (e.g. csv, xml, txt, xls, json) with the given file name to the temporary path. It is then emailed to the recipient list, and the temporary file removed. emailreport[\"./tempdir/\"; (\"test@aquaq.co.uk\";\"test1@aquaq.co.uk\"); \"EndOfDayReport\"; \"csv\"] publishresult - Accepts 1 parameter and that is the data. This is discussed later in the subsection subresults. Custom result handlers can be added to $KDBCODE/processes/reporter.q . It is important to note that the result handler is referencing local functions as it is executed in the reporter process and not the target process. When the query has been successful the result handler will be passed a dictionary with the following keys: queryid, time, name, procname, proctype and result. Report Process Tracking Each step of the query is logged by the reporter process. Each query is given a unique id and regular system messages are given the id 0. The stage column specifies what stage the query is in and these are shown in table [table:stagetable]. An appropriate log message is also shown so any problems can easily be diagnosed. The in memory table is flushed every interval depending on the value of the flushqueryloginterval variable in the reporter.q file found in the $KDBCONFIG/settings directory. Stage symbol Explanation R The query is currently running E An error has occurred during the query C The query has been completed with no errors T The query has exceeded the timeout interval S System message e.g. \u201cReporter Process Initialised\u201d time | queryid stage message -----------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2014.10.20D22:20:06.597035000| 37 R \"Received result\" 2014.10.20D22:20:06.600692000| 37 R \"Running resulthandler\" 2014.10.20D22:20:06.604455000| 37 C \"Finished report\" 2014.10.20D22:30:00.984572000| 38 R \"Running report: rdbtablecount against proctype: rdb on handle: 7i\" 2014.10.20D22:30:00.991862000| 38 R \"Received result\" 2014.10.20D22:30:00.995527000| 38 R \"Running resulthandler\" 2014.10.20D22:30:00.999236000| 38 C \"Finished report\" 2014.10.20D22:30:06.784419000| 39 R \"Running report: rdbtablecount against proctype: rdb on handle: 7i\" 2014.10.20D22:30:06.796431000| 39 R \"Received result\" Subscribing for Results To publish the results of the report, the reporter process uses the pub sub functionality of TorQ. This is done by using the using the inbuilt result handler called publishresult. In order to subscribe to this feed, connect to the reporter process and send the function shown below over the handle. To subscribe to all reports use a backtick as the second parameter and to subscribe to a specific reports results include the reporter name as a symbol. /- define a upd function upd:insert /- handle to reporter process h: hopen 20004 /- Subscribe to all results that use the publishresult handler h(`.ps.subscribe;`reporterprocessresults;`) /- Subscribe to a specific report called testreport h(`.ps.subscribe;`reporterprocessresults;`testreport) Example reports The following are examples of reports that could be used in the reporter process. The rdbtablecount report will run hourly and return the count of all the tables in a rdb process. The memoryusage report will run every 10 minutes against the gateway for multiple processes and will return the .Q.w[] information. Both of these reports run between 9:30am to 4:00pm during the weekdays. The report onetimequery is an example of a query that is run one time, in order to run a query once, the period must be the same as the difference between the start and end time. name|query|resulthandler|gateway|joinfunction|proctype|procname|start|end|period|timeoutinterval|daysofweek rdbtablecount|ts!count each value each ts:tables[]|{show x`result}|||rdb|rdb1|09:30|16:00|01:00|00:00:10|2 3 4 5 6 memoryusage|.Q.w[]|writetofile[\"./output/\";\"memory.csv\"]|gateway1|{enlist raze x}|rdb hdb||09:30|16:00|00:10|00:00:10|2 3 4 5 6 onetimequery|10#.usage.usage|writetofile[\"./output/\";\"onetime.csv\"]|||rdb||10:00|10:01|00:01|00:00:10|2 3 4 5 6 Monitor The Monitor process is a simple process to monitor the health of the other processes in the system. It connects to each process that it finds (by default using the discovery service, though can use the static file as well) and subscribes to both heartbeats and log messages. It maintains a keyed table of heartbeats, and a table of all log messages received. Run it with: aquaq $ q torq.q -load code/processes/monitor.q -p 20001 -proctype monitor -procname monitor1 It is probably advisable to run the monitor process with the -trap flag, as there may be some start up errors if the processes it is connecting to do not have the necessary heartbeating or publish/subscribe code loaded. aquaq $ q torq.q -load code/processes/monitor.q -p 20001 -trap -proctype monitor -procname monitor1 The current heartbeat statuses are tracked in .hb.hb, and the log messages in logmsg q)show .hb.hb sym procname | time counter warning error ----------------------| --------------------------------------------------- discovery discovery2 | 2014.01.07D13:24:31.848257000 893 0 0 hdb hdb1 | 2014.01.07D13:24:31.866459000 955 0 0 rdb rdb_europe_1| 2014.01.07D13:23:31.507203000 901 1 0 rdb rdb1 | 2014.01.07D13:24:31.848259000 34 0 0 q)show select from logmsg where loglevel=`ERR time sym host loglevel id message ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2014.01.07D12:25:17.457535000 hdb1 aquaq ERR reload \"failed to reload database\" 2014.01.07D13:29:28.784333000 rdb1 aquaq ERR eodsave \"failed to save tables : trade, quote\" Checkmonitor The checkmonitor.q script extends the functionality of the monitor process. The script takes a set of user defined configuration settings for a set of process specific checks. These can initially be provided in the form of a CSV, a sample of which is shown here: family|metric|process|query|resultchecker|params|period|runtime datacount|tradecount|rdb1|{count trade}|checkcount|`varname`count`cond!(`trade;10;`morethan)|0D00:01|0D00:00:01 Upon start up, the CSV file is loaded and inserted into the in-memory table, checkconfig . During this insertion, each check will also be assigned a unique checkid number. q)checkconfig checkid| family metric process query resultchecker params period runtime active -------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 | datacount tradecount rdb1 \"{count trade}\" \"checkcount\" `varname`count`cond!(`trade;10;`morethan) 0D00:01:00.000000000 0D00:00:01.000000000 1 For each check, the query will be sent via asynchronous requests to the specified processes and waits for postback of the results. Once the monitoring process receives the result of the query, it will then be checked by the resultchecker function to identify whether it will pass or fail. Result checker functions must only take two parameters: p- a parameter dictionary, and r- the result row. The status in r will be modified based on whether the r result value passes the conditions specified by the resultchecker function. q)checkcount {[p;r] if[`morethan=p`cond; if[p[`count]<r`result; :`status`result!(1h;\"\")]; :`status`result!(0h;\"variable \",(string p`varname),\" has count of \",(string r`result),\" but requires \",string p`count)]; if[`lessthan=p`cond; if[p[`count]>r`result; :`status`result!(1h;\"\")]; :`status`result!(0h;\"variable \",(string p`varname),\" has count of \",(string r`result),\" but should be less than \",string p`count)]; } q)p varname| `trade count | 10 cond | `morethan q)r status| 1h result| \"\" This example checks whether the trade table within the rdb is larger than 10. As this is true, the status has been set to 1h and no error message has been returned. This information is inserted into the checkstatus table, which is the primary table where all results are stored. q)checkstatus checkid| family metric process lastrun nextrun status executiontime totaltime timerstatus running result -------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 | datacount tradecount rdb1 2019.02.18D10:58:45.908919000 2019.02.18D10:59:45.911635000 1 0D00:00:00.000017000 0D00:00:00.002677000 1 0 \"\" In addition to tracking the status of the specified queries, a number of metrics are also returned in the checkstatus table. Column Header Value Type Description lastrun Timestamp Last time check was run nextrun Timestamp Next time check is scheduled to run status Boolean Indicates whether query result has passed resultchecker function executiontime Timespan Time taken for last query to be executed totaltime Timespan Total time taken for check to be run, including sending times and execution timerstatus Boolean Indicates whether last totaltime was executed under threshold value running Boolean Indicates whether check is currently running results String Will display any errors or additional information regarding running checks The function checkruntime uses the running column to identify functions that are running extremely slow, and set their status and timerstatus to 0h. When the process is exited, the .z.exit has been modified to save the checkconfig table as a flat binary file. This will then be preferentially loaded next time the process is started up again. The process of saving down the in-memory functions makes altering configuration parameters easier. Four functions are available to do so: addcheck , updateconfig , updateconfigfammet and forceconfig . Function Name Description addcheck[dictionary] addcheck allows a new check to be added, and accepts a dictionary as its argument. The keys must be a match to the current checkconfig table, and the values must be of the correct type. updateconfig[checkid;paramkey;newval] updateconfig changes the parameter key of an existing check, using the checkid to specify which check to alter. The type of the new parameter value must match the current value type. forceconfig[checkid;newconfig] forceconfig changes the parameter keys of an existing check and will not check for types. updateconfigfammet[family;metric;paramkey;newval] updateconfig changes the parameter key of an existing check, using the family and metric combination to specify which check to alter. If this combination does not exist, the function will return an error. The type of the new parameter value must match the current value type. There are other additional functions that are useful for using the check monitor. Function Name Value Type currentstatus Will return only status, timerstatus, result and running from the checktracker table. It accepts a list of checkids, or will return all checks if passed a null. timecheck Will check the median time for current checks to be run against a user-defined timespan. It returns a table displaying the median time and a boolean value. statusbyfam Function will return a table of all checks from specified families, ordered firstly by status, and then by timestatus. If a null is provided, ordered checks from all families will be returned. All checks can be tracked using the table checktracker . Here, each run is assigned a unique runid- thus individual runs for each check can be tracked. For each run, it tracks the time tkane for target process to recieve the query, as well as the execution time. The result value will also be displayed. HTML5 front end A HTML5 front end has been built to display important process information that is sent from the monitor process. It uses HTML5, WebSockets and JavaScript on the front end and interacts with the monitor process in the kdb+ side. The features of the front end include: Heartbeat table with processes that have warnings highlighted in orange and errors in red Log message table displaying the last 30 errors Log message error chart that is by default displayed in 5 minute bins Chart\u2019s bin value can be changed on the fly Responsive design so works on all main devices i.e. phones, tablets and desktop It is accessible by going to the url http://HOST:PORT/.non?monitorui Compression The compression process is a thin wrapper around the compression utility library. It allows periodic compression of whole or parts of databases (e.g. data is written out uncompressed and then compressed after a certain period of time). It uses four variables defined in KDBCONFIG/settings/compression.q which specify the compression configuration file to use the database directory to compress the maximum age of data to attempt to compress whether the process should exit upon completion The process is run like other TorQ processes: q torq.q -load code/processes/compression.q -p 20005 -proctype compression -procname compression1 Modify the settings file or override variables from the command line as appropriate. Kill The kill process is used to connect to and terminate currently running processes. It kills the process by sending the exit command therefore the kill process must have appropriate permissions to send the command, and it must be able to create a connection (i.e. it will not be able to kill a blocked process in the same way that the unix command kill -9 would). By default, the kill process will connect to the discovery service(s), and kill the processes of the specified types. The kill process can be modified to not use the discovery service and instead use the process.csv file via the configuration in the standard way. If run without any command line parameters, kill.q will try to kill each process it finds with type defined by its .servers.CONNECTIONS variable. q torq.q -load code/processes/kill.q -p 20000 -proctype kill -procname killtick .servers.CONNECTIONS can optionally be overridden from the command line (as can any other process variable): q torq.q -load code/processes/kill.q -p 20000 -.servers.CONNECTIONS rdb tickerplant -proctype kill -procname killtick The kill process can also be used to kill only specific named processes within the process types: q torq.q -load code/processes/kill.q -p 20000 -killnames hdb1 hdb2 -proctype kill -procname killtick Chained Tickerplant In tick+ architecture the main tickerplant is the most important component, as it is relied upon by all the real time subscribers. When the tickerplant goes down data will be lost, compare this to an rdb which can be recovered after it fails. The chained tickerplant process is an additional tickerplant that is a real time subscriber to the main tickerplant but replicates its behaviour. It will have its own real time subscribers and can be recovered when it fails. This is the recommended approach when users want to perform their own custom real time analysis. The chained tickerplant can: subscribe to specific tables and syms batch publish at an interval or publish tick by tick create a tickerplant log that its real time subscribers can replay replay the source tickerplant log To launch the chained tickerplant q torq.q -load code/processes/chainedtp.q -p 12009 -proctype chainedtp -procname chainedtp1 Chained tickerplant settings are found in config/settings/chainedtp.q and are under the .ctp namespace.

An RDB process could be running, but capturing and populating its tables with null values, or not running at all. These errors would not be caught by the Monitor process, so the Data Quality System has been developed with the purpose of capturing such errors. The system periodically runs a set of user-specified checks on selected processes to ensure data quality. For example, you can place checks on a table to periodically check that the percentage of nulls it contains in a certain column is below a given threshold, or check that the values of a column stay within a specified range that changes throughout the day. The system behaves based on Data Quality Config files. The metrics from the config files and the results of the checks performed on databases in the data capturing system are saved to Data Quality Databases. The results can then be used for monitoring tools to alert users. The Data Quality System consists of four processes: the Data Quality Checker(DQC) and the Data Quality Engine(DQE), as well as a Database process for each (DQCDB and DQEDB). These processes are explained in detail below. Data Quality Checker (DQC) The Data Quality Checker process runs checks on other TorQ processes to check the quality of data in the system. The specific parameters of the checks that are being run can be configured in config/dqcconfig.csv . Configuration from dqcconfig.csv is then loaded to configtable in the dqe namespace, and the checks are then run based on the parameters. The results of the checks are saved to the results table in the dqe namespace. The results table that contains all check results will periodically be saved to the DQCDB intraday. The configuration of the checks will also be periodically saved to the DQCDB throughout the day. Example of configtable is shown below: action params proc mode starttime endtime period checkid -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- tableticking \"`comp`vars!(0b;(`quote;5;`minute))\" \"`rdb1\" repeat 2020.03.20D09:00:00.000000000 0D00:05:00.000000000 0 chkslowsub \"`comp`vars!(0b;1000000)\" \"`tickerplant\" repeat 2020.03.20D09:00:00.000000000 2020.03.20D19:00:00.000000000 0D00:10:00.000000000 1 tableticking \"`comp`vars!(0b;(`quote;5;`minute))\" \"`rdb1\" single 2020.03.20D12:00:00.000000000 2 constructcheck \"`comp`vars!(0b;(`quote;`table))\" \"`rdb1\" repeat 2020.03.20D09:00:00.000000000 0D00:02:00.000000000 3 constructcheck \"`comp`compallow`compproc`vars!(1b;0;`hdb1;(`date;`variable))\" \"`hdb2\" repeat 2020.03.20D09:00:00.000000000 0D00:02:00.000000000 4 attrcheck \"`comp`vars!(0b;(`quote;`s`g;`time`sym))\" \"`rdb1\" repeat 2020.03.20D09:00:00.000000000 0D00:02:00.000000000 5 schemacheck \"`comp`vars!(0b;(`quote;`time`sym`bid`ask`bsize`asize`mode`ex`src;\\\"psffjjccs\\\";`````````;`s`g```````))\" \"`rdb1\" repeat 2020.03.20D09:00:00.000000000 0D00:15:00.000000000 6 freeform \"`comp`vars!(0b;\\\"select from trade where date=2020.01.02\\\")\" \"`hdb1\" repeat 2020.03.20D09:00:00.000000000 0D00:03:00.000000000 7 symfilecheck \"(`comp`vars!(0b;(.dqe.hdbdir;`sym)))\" \"`hdb1\" repeat 2020.03.20D09:00:00.000000000 0D00:10:00.000000000 8 xmarketalert \"`comp`vars!(0b;(`quote))\" \"`rdb1\" repeat 2020.03.20D09:00:00.000000000 0D00:05:00.000000000 9 action - The check function that you would like to perform. Specific checks and usages can be found in the directory code/dqc . params - The parameters that are used by the function. The Checker accepts params as a dictionary, with comp and vars being the two keys when function is only used on one process, and comp , compallow , compproc , and vars being the four keys when function is used to compare two processes. comp should be assigned a boolean value - when it is 1b , comparison is ON and the function is then used to compare two processes. compallow would then be the percentage allowed for for the difference between the results that are returned from the two processes. compproc would be the process that you are comparing proc with. vars would be the variable used for the function provided. When it is 0b , comparison is OFF and the function is only used in one process. The var key should have a value of all the variables that are used by the function. Details of the variables used by checker functions can be found in config/dqedetail.csv . proc - The process(es) that you would want the check function to be used for - in symbol datatype. mode - Mode could be set to either repeat or single . When it is set to repeat the check will be periodically run based on the period parameter, which sets the time it will take before running the same check again. When it is set to single , the check will only be ran once. starttime - The start time of the check function - in timespan datatype. endtime - When mode is repeat , end time specifies when the check will run for the last time for the day. When mode is single , endtime should be set to 0N . Should be in timespan datatype. period - When mode is repeat , period represents the time it takes for the next run to start. When mode is single , period should be set to 0N . Should be in timespan datatype.

In the sample table above, .dqc.construckcheck with the id 3 that checks whether quote table exists and .dqc.construckcheck with the id 4 that checks whether data in hdb1 matches hdb2 had two results showing as they have been ran twice within that time period, but the parameters of the checks have not been changed. The id column is also useful for manually running checks. funct - The check function that was performed. params - The variables that were input while the check function was performed. procs - The process(es) type that the function was performed on. procschk - The specific process(es) that the function was performed on. starttime - When the function was started. endtime - When the function stopped running. result - Returns a boolean value. If the result is 1 , then the function was ran successfully, and no data anomaly was found. If the result is 0 , then the function may not have been run successfully, or the data quality may be corrupted. descp - A string description describing the result of the check function. chkstatus - Could display either complete or failed . When the check function runs successfully, whether the result column is 0 or 1, chkstatus would be complete . However, if there was an error that caused the check to not run successfully(Ex: variables being a wrong type), failed would be displayed instead. chkruntype - Could display either scheduled or manual , meaning either the check was ran as scheduled from the configtable, or it was forced to run manually from the console. Below, we list all the built-in checks that we offer as part of the Data Quality Checker. .dqc.constructcheck - Checks if a construct exists. .dqc.tableticking - Checks if a table has obtained records within a specified time period. .dqc.chkslowsub - Checks queues on handles to make sure there are no slow subscribers. .dqc.tablecount - Checks a table count against a number. This can be a > , < or = relationship. .dqc.tablehasrecords - A projection of .dqc.tablecount that is used to check if a table is non-empty. .dqc.attrcheck - Checks that a tables actual schema matches the expectation. .dqc.infinitychk - Checks the percentage of infinities in certain columns of a table are below a given threshold. .dqc.freeform - Checks if a query has passed correctly. .dqc.schemacheck - Checks if the meta of a table matches expectation. .dqc.datechk - Checks the date vector contains the latest date in a HDB. .dqc.nullchk - Checks percentages of nulls in columns of a table are below a given threshold. .dqc.symfilecheck - Checks that the sym file exists. .dqc.xmarketalert - Tests whether the bid price has exceeded in the ask price in market data. .dqc.dfilechk - Checks the .d file in the latest date partition matches the previous date values. .dqc.rangechk - Checks whether the values of columns of a table are within a given range. .dqc.tablecomp - Counts the number of rows in a table, used for comparison between two processes .dqc.pctAvgDailyChange - Checks if a function applied to a table is within the threshold limits of an n-day average. .dqc.symfilegrowth - Checks if today's sym file count has grown more than a certain percentage .dqc.timdiff - Checks if idfferences between time columns are over a certain limit .dqc.memoryusage - Checks percentage of memory usage compared to max memory .dqc.refdatacheck - Checks whether the referenced column of a table is in another column of another table New Custom Check To add custom checks, create a new q file in /code/dqc. The new q script should be under the namespace dqc, and should contain the function. The function should return a mixed list with two atoms: first atom being boolean, and second being string. The first atom would contain whether the check was successful (1b) or was there an error/failed check(0b). This will be shown in the result column of the results table. The second atom would contain the description of the result of the check. Below is a sample of a qscript named customcheck.q, with the function customcheck, written in pseudo-code for reference: \\d .dqc customcheck:{[variable1;variable2] $[variable1~variable2; (1b;\"Description if the function ran successfully\"); (0b;\"Description if the function failed to run\")] } To use the function to run check, proceed to /appconfig/dqcconfig.csv, and modify how you would want the check to be ran. As an example, to run the customcheck above with the following settings - params - Not comparing two processes, and running with the two variables being abc and def . proc - running on the processes rdb1 and rdb2 . mode - the function being run repeatedly. starttime - 9AM. endtime - not specified. period - the check to be run every 10 minutes. The line in dqcconfig.csv should be: action,params,proc,mode,starttime,endtime,period customcheck,`comp`vars!(0b;(`abc;`def)),`rdb1;`rdb2,repeat,09:00:00.000000000,0Wn,0D00:10:00 To add a check that compares two processes, the check function would have to return a mixed listed with three atoms. The first two being the same as above, and the third being a numeric value. The numeric value would be what is compared between the two processes.

As mentioned above, the params parameter would now have to be changed, and two additional dictionary keys would have to be added. As an example, if we were to run the function customcheck comparing hdb1 and hdb2 , with there being no difference allowed between the two results returned from the two processes, the line would be the following: action,params,proc,mode,starttime,endtime,period customcheck,`comp`compallow`compproc`vars!(1b;0;`hdb1;(`abc;`def)),`hdb2,repeat,09:00:00.000000000,0Wn,0D00:10:00 If we were to allow for 50% difference between the results returned from the two processes using the function customcheck, the line would be the following: action,params,proc,mode,starttime,endtime,period customcheck,`comp`compallow`compproc`vars!(1b;50;`hdb1;(`abc;`def)),`hdb2,repeat,09:00:00.000000000,0Wn,0D00:10:00 Data Quality Engine (DQE) The DQE process stores daily statistics of other TorQ processes. It is a separate process from the DQC because the DQE does not run checks. The DQE and the DQC could be used to track the percentage change of records in a table from day to day. The Checker can then use the data saved the DQEDB to perform advanced checks.The behaviour of the Engine is based on the config file stored in config/dqengineconfig.csv . The config csv file is shown below: query,params,proc,querytype,starttime ------------------------------------- tablecount,.z.d-1,`hdb1,table,09:00:00.000000000 symfilecheck,`sym,`hdb1,other,09:00:00.000000000 symcount,(`quote;`sym),`hdb1,table,09:00:00.000000000 query - The query function that is used to provide daily statistics of a process. params - the variables that is used for the query function. proc - The process that the query function is running on. querytype - Whether the query is ran for a table or other . starttime - What time should the query start. The daily statistics of other TorQ processes are saved to the resultstab and the advancedres tables in dqe namespace, which would be saved to Data Quality Engine Database (DQEDB). The resultstab table contains the results of simple qeuries that return intger values that is reflected by the column resvalue . The advancedres table contains the results of advanced queries that return whole tables, which is reflected by the column \"resultdata\". Example of resultstab is shown below: date procs funct table column resvalue ------------------------------------------------------- 2020.03.16 hdb1 tablecount quote 0 2020.03.16 hdb1 tablecount quote_iex 0 2020.03.16 hdb1 tablecount trade 0 2020.03.16 hdb1 tablecount trade_iex 0 2020.03.16 hdb1 symfilecheck 10 2020.03.16 hdb1 symcount quote sym 10 date - Date that the data was saved. procs - The process that the query function was running on. funct - The query function that was used. table - Table that the function ran on.

New Custom Queries To add custom queries, create a new q file in /code/dqe. The new q script should be under the namespace dqe, and should contain the function. The function should return a dictionary, With the key being the function name, and the value being the statistic that the query should return. The value from the dictionary will be shown as the resvalue in the resultstab table. Below is a sample of a qscript named customquery.q, with the function customquery, written in pseudo-code for reference: \\d .dqe customquery:{[variable1;variable2] (enlist variable1)!enlist count variable2 } To use the function to run check, proceed to /appconfig/dqengineconfig.csv, and modify how you would want the check to be ran. As an example, to run the customquery above with the following settings - params - Variable being abc . proc - running on the process hdb1 . querytype - other as it is not a table starttime - 9AM The line in the config csv should be: query,params,proc,querytype,starttime customquery,`table`quote,`hdb1,other,09:00:00.000000000","title":"Processes"},{"location":"Processes/#processes","text":"A set of processes is included.

The gateway can be used for load balancing and/or to join the results of queries across heterogeneous servers (e.g. an RDB and HDB). Ideally the gateway should only be used with asynchronous calls. Prior to KDB v3.6, synchronous calls caused the gateway to block which limits the gateway to serving one query at a time (although if querying across multiple backend servers the backend queries will be run in parallel). For v3.6+, deferred synchronous requests to the gateway are supported. This allows the gateway to process multiple synchronous requests at once, therefore removing the requirement for the gateway to allow only one type of request. When using asynchronous calls, the client can either block and wait for the result (deferred synchronous) or post a call back function which the gateway will call back to the client with. The backend servers to be queried against with asynchronous and synchronous queries are selected using process type. The gateway API can be seen by querying .api.p\u201c.gw.*\u201d within a gateway process.","title":"Gateway"},{"location":"Processes/#asynchronous-behaviour","text":"Asynchronous queries allow much greater flexibility. They allow multiple queries to be serviced at once, prioritisation, and queries to be timed out. When an asynchronous query is received the following happens: the query is placed in a queue; the list of available servers is retrieved; the queue is prioritised, so those queries with higher priority are serviced first; queries are sent to back end servers as they become available. Once the backend server returns its result, it is given another query; when all the partial results from the query are returned the results are aggregated and returned to the client. They are either returned directly, or wrapped in a callback and posted back asynchronously to the client. The two main customisable features of the gateway are the selection of available servers (.gw.availableservers) and the queue prioritisation (.gw.getnextqueryid). With default configuration, the available servers are those servers which are not currently servicing a query from the gateway, and the queue priority is a simple FIFO queue. The available servers could be extended to handle process attributes, such as the available datasets or the location of the process, and the queue prioritisation could be modified to anything required e.g. based on the query itself, the username, host of the client etc. An asynchronous query can be timed out using a timeout defined by the client. The gateway will periodically check if any client queries have not completed in the alotted time, and return a timeout error to the client. If the query is already running on any backend servers then they cannot be timed out other than by using the standard -T flag.","title":"Asynchronous Behaviour"},{"location":"Processes/#synchronous-behaviour","text":"Prior to KDB v3.6, when using synchronous queries the gateway could only handle one query at a time and cannot timeout queries other than with the standard -T flag.

(The exception being with TorQ-FSP, in which case it is set to 1b by default.) For v3.6+, deferred synchronous calls are supported, allowing the gateway to process multiple requests at a time.

Each response to the client is passed through this function with inputs status (1b=result,0b=error), sync (1b=sync,0b=async) and result (result/error) to allow different errors/results to be handled appropriately. As default, when synchronous calls are used, q errors are returned to clients as they are encountered. When using asynchronous calls, appropriately prefixed strings are used. It is up to the client to check the type of the received result and if it is a string then whether it contains the error prefix. The error prefix can be changed, but the default is \u201cerror: \u201d. Alternatively, the formatresult function can be altered as necessary. Errors will be returned when: the client requests a query against a server type which the gateway does not currently have any active instances of (this error is returned immediately); the client requests a query with the wrong servertype types; the client requests a query with null servers; the query is timed out; a back end server returns an error; a back end server fails; the join function fails.

The WDB process can broken down into two main functions: Periodically saving data to disk and Sorting data at end of day The WDB process provides flexibility so it can be set-up as a stand-alone process that will both save and sort data or two separate processes (one that saves the data and another that will sort the data on disk). This allows greater flexibility around the end of day event as sorting data can be time consuming. It is also helps when implementing seemless rollovers (i.e. no outage window at end-of-day). The behaviour of the WDB process is controlled by the .wdb.mode parameter. This should be set to one of following three values: saveandsort - the process will subscribe for data, periodically write data to disk and at EOD it will flush remaining data to disk before sorting it and informing GWs, RDBs and HDBs etc. save - the process will subscribe for data, periodically write data to disk and at EOD it will flush remaining data to disk. It will then inform its respective sort mode process to sort the data sort - the process will wait to get a trigger from its respective save mode process. When this is triggered it will sort the data on disk, apply attributes and the trigger a reload on the RDB, HDB and GW processes When running a system with separate save and sort process, the sort process should be configured in the processes.csv file with a proctype of sort. The save process will check for processes with a proctype of sort when it attempts to trigger the end of day sort of the data. The wdb process provides two methods for persisting data to disk and sorting at the end of the day. default - Data is persisted into a partition defined by the [partitiontype] variable, similar to the hdb partition scheme. The general scheme is of the form [wdbdir]/[partitiontype]/[table]/. And a typical partition directory would be similar to wdb/database/2015.11.26/trades/. At the end of the day, before being moved to the hdb, the data is sorted according to parameters defined in sort.csv. For each table, sort.csv will specify the columns to sort (using xasc) and apply attributes to. partbyattr - Data is persisted to a custom partition scheme, derived from parameters in the sort.csv file. The write down scheme is taken from sort.csv, to reflect the effect of using xasc at the end of day. For each table, the columns defined in sort.csv, with the parted attribute, are used to create custom partitions in the wdb. Multiple columns can be defined with the parted attribute and distinct combinations of each are generated for custom partitions. The general partition scheme is of the form [wdbdir]/[partitiontype]/[table]/[parted column(s)]/. And a typical partition directory would be similar to wdb/database/2015.11.26/trade/MSFT_N. In the above example, the data is parted by sym and source, and so a unique partition directory MSFT_N is created in the wdb directory. At the end of the day, data is upserted into the hdb without the need for sorting. The number of rows that are joined at once is limited by the mergenumrows and mergenumtab parameters. The optional partbyattr method may provide a significant saving in time at the end of day, allowing the hdb to be accessed sooner. For large data sets with a low cardinality (ie. small number of distinct elements) the optional method may provide a significant time saving, upwards of 50%. The optional method should also reduce the memory usage at the end of day event, as joining data is generally less memory intensive than sorting.","title":"Write Database (WDB)"},{"location":"Processes/#tickerplant-log-replay","text":"The Tickerplant Log Replay script is for replaying tickerplant logs. This is useful for: handling end of day save down failures; handling large volumes of data (larger than can fit into RAM).

Amongst other functionality, the process can: replay specific message ranges; replay in manageable message chunks; recover as many messages as possible from a log file rather than just stopping at the first bad message; ignore specific tables; modify the tables before or after they are saved; apply sorting and parting after all the data is written out.

The process will run the housekeeping jobs periodically on a timer. Amongst other functionality the process: Allows for removing and zipping of directory files; Provides an inbuilt search utility and selectively searches using a \u2018find\u2019 and \u2018exclude\u2019 string, and an \u2018older than\u2019 parameter; Reads all tasks from a single CSV; Runs on a user defined timer; Can be run immediately from command line or within the process; Can be easily extended to include new user defined housekeeping tasks. The process has two main parameters that should be set prior to use; runtimes and inputcsv.\u2018Runtimes\u2019 sets the timer to run housekeeping at the set time(s), and \u2018Inputcsv\u2019 provides the location of the housekeeping csv file. These can either be set in the config file, or overridden via the command line. If these are not set, then default parameters are used; 12.00 and \u2018KDBCONFIG/housekeeping.csv\u2019 respectively. The process is designed to run from a single csv file with five headings: Function details the action that you wish to be carried out on the files, initially, this can be rm (remove) and zip (zipping); Path specifies the directory that the files are in; Match provides the search string to the find function, files returned will have names that match this string; Exclude provides a second string to the find function, and these files are excluded from the match list; Age is the \u2018older than\u2019 parameter, and the function will only be carried out on files older than the age given (in days). An example csv file would be: function,path,match,exclude,age zip,./logs/,*.log,*tick*,2 rm,./logs/,*.log*,*tick*,4 zip,./logs/,*tick*,,1 rm,./logs/,*tick*,,3 function path match exclude age ---------------------------------------- zip \"./logs/\" \"*.log\" \"*tick*\" 2 rm \"./logs/\" \"*.log*\" \"*tick*\" 4 zip \"./logs/\" \"*tick*\" \"\" 1 rm \"./logs/\" \"*tick*\" \"\" 3 The process reads in the csv file, and passes it line by line to a \u2018find\u2019 function; providing a dictionary of values that can be used to locate the files required. The find function takes advantage of system commands to search for the files according to the specifications in the dictionary. A search is performed for both the match string and the exclude string, and cross referenced to produce a list of files that match the parameters given. The files are then each passed to a further set of system commands to perform the task of either zipping or removing. Note that an incomplete csv or non-existant path will throw an error. The remove and zipping functions form only basic implimentations of the housekeeping process; it is designed to be exended to include more actions than those provided. Any user function defined in the housekeeping code can be employed in the same fashion by providing the name of the function,search string and age of files to the csv. As well as being scheduled on a timer, the process can also be run immediately. Adding \u2018-hk.runnow 1\u2019 to the command line when starting the process will force immediate running of the actions in the housekeeping csv. Likewise, setting runnow to 1b in the config file will immediately run the cleaning process. Both methods will cause the process to exit upon completion. Calling hkrun[] from within the q process will also run the csv instructions immediately. This will not affect any timer scheduling and the process will remain open upon completion. Housekeeping works both on windows and unix based systems. Since the process utilizes inbuilt system commands to perform maintenances, a unix/windows switch detects the operating system of the host and applies either unix or widows functions appropriately. Extensions need only be made in the namespace of the hosting operating system (i.e. if you are using a unix system, and wish to add a new function, you do not need to add the function to the windows namespace to).

If a matching file is found it will then carry out a user-defined function on it. The files to search for and the functions to run are read in from a csv file. Additionally, the file alerter process can: run more than one function on the specified file. optionally move the file to a new directory after running the function. store a table of files that have already been processed. run the function only on new files or run it every time the file is modified. ignore any matching files already on the system when the process starts and only run a function if a new file is added or a file is modified. The file alerter process has four parameters which should be set prior to use. These parameters can either be set in the config file or overridden on the command-line. If they are not set, the default parameters will be used. The parameters are as follows. inputcsv - The name and location of the csv file which defines the behaviour of the process. The default is KDBCONFIG/filealerter.csv. polltime - How often the process will scan for matching files. The default is 0D:00:01, i.e., every minute. alreadyprocessed - The name and location of the already-processed table. The default is KDBCONFIG/filealerterprocessed. This table will be created automatically the first time the process is ran. skipallonstart - If this is set to 1, it will ignore all files already on the system; if it is set to 0, it will not. The default value is 0. The files to find and the functions to run are read in from a csv file created by the user. This file has five columns, which are detailed below. path - This is the path to the directory that will be scanned for the file. match - This is a search string matching the name of the file to be found. Wildcards can be used in this search, for example, \u201cfile*\u201d will find all files starting with \u201cfil\u201d. function - This is the name of the function to be run on the file. This function must be defined in the script KDBCODE/processes/filealerter.q. If the function is not defined or fails to run, the process will throw an error and ignore that file from then on. newonly - This is a boolean value. If it is set to 1, it will only run the function on the file if it has been newly created. If it is set to 0, then it will run the function every time the file is modified. movetodirectory - This is the path of the directory you would like to move the file to after it has been processed. If this value is left blank, the file will not be moved. It is possible to run two separate functions on the same file by adding them as separate lines in the csv file. If the file is to be moved after it is processed, the file alerter will run both functions on the file and then attempt to move it. A typical csv file to configure the file alerter would look like: path,match,function,newonly,movetodirectory /path/to/dirA,fileA.*,copy,0,/path/to/newDir /path/to/dirB,fileB.txt,email,1, /path/to/dirA,fileA.*,delete,0,/path/to/newDir path match function newonly movetodirectory --------------------------------------------------- \"/path/to/dirA\" \"fileA.*\" copy 0 \"/path/to/newDir\" \"/path/to/dirB\" \"fileB.txt\" email 1 \"\" \"/path/to/dirA\" \"fileA.*\" delete 0 \"/path/to/newDir\" The file alerter process reads in each line of the csv file and searches files matching the search string specified in that line. Note that there may be more than one file found if a wildcard is used in the search string. If it finds any files, it will check that they are not in the already processed table. If newonly is set to 1, it only checks if the filename is already in the table. If newonly is set to 0, it checks against the filename, filesize and a md5 hash of the file. The md5 hash and the filesize are used to determine if the file has been modified since it was processed last. If the found files have not been processed already, it then attempts to run the specified function to these files. After the process has run through each line of the csv, it generates a table of all files that were processed on that run. These files are appended to the already processed table which is then saved to disk. The file alerter will attempt to move the files to the \u2018movetodirectory\u2019, if specified. If the file has already been moved during the process (for example, if the function to run on it was \u2018delete\u2019), the file alerter will not attempt to move it. The file alerter is designed to be extended by the user. Customised functions should be defined within the filealerter.q script. They should be diadic functions, i.e., they take two parameters: the path and the filename. As an example, a simple function to make a copy of a file in another directory could be: copy:{[path;file] system \"cp \", path,\"/\", file, \" /path/to/newDir\"} Although the process is designed to run at regular intervals throughout the day, it can be called manually by invoking the FArun[] command from within the q session. Similarly, if new lines are added to the csv file, then it can be re-loaded by calling the loadcsv[] command from the q session. Each stage of the process, along with any errors which may occur, are appropriately logged in the usual manner. The file alerter process is designed to work on both Windows and Unix based systems. Since many of the functions defined will use inbuilt system command they will be need to written to suit the operating system in use. It should also be noted that Windows does not have an inbuilt md5 hashing function so the file alerter will only detect different versions of files if the filename or filesize changes.","title":"File Alerter"},{"location":"Processes/#reporter","text":"","title":"Reporter"},{"location":"Processes/#overview_1","text":"The reporter process is used to run periodic reports on specific processes.

Once the monitoring process receives the result of the query, it will then be checked by the resultchecker function to identify whether it will pass or fail.

When the process is exited, the .z.exit has been modified to save the checkconfig table as a flat binary file. This will then be preferentially loaded next time the process is started up again. The process of saving down the in-memory functions makes altering configuration parameters easier. Four functions are available to do so: addcheck , updateconfig , updateconfigfammet and forceconfig . Function Name Description addcheck[dictionary] addcheck allows a new check to be added, and accepts a dictionary as its argument. The keys must be a match to the current checkconfig table, and the values must be of the correct type. updateconfig[checkid;paramkey;newval] updateconfig changes the parameter key of an existing check, using the checkid to specify which check to alter. The type of the new parameter value must match the current value type. forceconfig[checkid;newconfig] forceconfig changes the parameter keys of an existing check and will not check for types. updateconfigfammet[family;metric;paramkey;newval] updateconfig changes the parameter key of an existing check, using the family and metric combination to specify which check to alter. If this combination does not exist, the function will return an error. The type of the new parameter value must match the current value type. There are other additional functions that are useful for using the check monitor. Function Name Value Type currentstatus Will return only status, timerstatus, result and running from the checktracker table. It accepts a list of checkids, or will return all checks if passed a null. timecheck Will check the median time for current checks to be run against a user-defined timespan. It returns a table displaying the median time and a boolean value. statusbyfam Function will return a table of all checks from specified families, ordered firstly by status, and then by timestatus. If a null is provided, ordered checks from all families will be returned. All checks can be tracked using the table checktracker . Here, each run is assigned a unique runid- thus individual runs for each check can be tracked. For each run, it tracks the time tkane for target process to recieve the query, as well as the execution time. The result value will also be displayed.","title":"Checkmonitor"},{"location":"Processes/#html5-front-end","text":"A HTML5 front end has been built to display important process information that is sent from the monitor process.

An RDB process could be running, but capturing and populating its tables with null values, or not running at all. These errors would not be caught by the Monitor process, so the Data Quality System has been developed with the purpose of capturing such errors. The system periodically runs a set of user-specified checks on selected processes to ensure data quality. For example, you can place checks on a table to periodically check that the percentage of nulls it contains in a certain column is below a given threshold, or check that the values of a column stay within a specified range that changes throughout the day. The system behaves based on Data Quality Config files. The metrics from the config files and the results of the checks performed on databases in the data capturing system are saved to Data Quality Databases. The results can then be used for monitoring tools to alert users. The Data Quality System consists of four processes: the Data Quality Checker(DQC) and the Data Quality Engine(DQE), as well as a Database process for each (DQCDB and DQEDB).

The id column is also useful for manually running checks. funct - The check function that was performed. params - The variables that were input while the check function was performed. procs - The process(es) type that the function was performed on. procschk - The specific process(es) that the function was performed on. starttime - When the function was started. endtime - When the function stopped running. result - Returns a boolean value. If the result is 1 , then the function was ran successfully, and no data anomaly was found. If the result is 0 , then the function may not have been run successfully, or the data quality may be corrupted. descp - A string description describing the result of the check function. chkstatus - Could display either complete or failed . When the check function runs successfully, whether the result column is 0 or 1, chkstatus would be complete . However, if there was an error that caused the check to not run successfully(Ex: variables being a wrong type), failed would be displayed instead. chkruntype - Could display either scheduled or manual , meaning either the check was ran as scheduled from the configtable, or it was forced to run manually from the console. Below, we list all the built-in checks that we offer as part of the Data Quality Checker. .dqc.constructcheck - Checks if a construct exists. .dqc.tableticking - Checks if a table has obtained records within a specified time period. .dqc.chkslowsub - Checks queues on handles to make sure there are no slow subscribers. .dqc.tablecount - Checks a table count against a number. This can be a > , < or = relationship. .dqc.tablehasrecords - A projection of .dqc.tablecount that is used to check if a table is non-empty. .dqc.attrcheck - Checks that a tables actual schema matches the expectation. .dqc.infinitychk - Checks the percentage of infinities in certain columns of a table are below a given threshold. .dqc.freeform - Checks if a query has passed correctly. .dqc.schemacheck - Checks if the meta of a table matches expectation. .dqc.datechk - Checks the date vector contains the latest date in a HDB. .dqc.nullchk - Checks percentages of nulls in columns of a table are below a given threshold. .dqc.symfilecheck - Checks that the sym file exists. .dqc.xmarketalert - Tests whether the bid price has exceeded in the ask price in market data. .dqc.dfilechk - Checks the .d file in the latest date partition matches the previous date values. .dqc.rangechk - Checks whether the values of columns of a table are within a given range. .dqc.tablecomp - Counts the number of rows in a table, used for comparison between two processes .dqc.pctAvgDailyChange - Checks if a function applied to a table is within the threshold limits of an n-day average. .dqc.symfilegrowth - Checks if today's sym file count has grown more than a certain percentage .dqc.timdiff - Checks if idfferences between time columns are over a certain limit .dqc.memoryusage - Checks percentage of memory usage compared to max memory .dqc.refdatacheck - Checks whether the referenced column of a table is in another column of another table New Custom Check To add custom checks, create a new q file in /code/dqc. The new q script should be under the namespace dqc, and should contain the function. The function should return a mixed list with two atoms: first atom being boolean, and second being string. The first atom would contain whether the check was successful (1b) or was there an error/failed check(0b). This will be shown in the result column of the results table. The second atom would contain the description of the result of the check. Below is a sample of a qscript named customcheck.q, with the function customcheck, written in pseudo-code for reference: \\d .dqc customcheck:{[variable1;variable2] $[variable1~variable2; (1b;\"Description if the function ran successfully\"); (0b;\"Description if the function failed to run\")] } To use the function to run check, proceed to /appconfig/dqcconfig.csv, and modify how you would want the check to be ran. As an example, to run the customcheck above with the following settings - params - Not comparing two processes, and running with the two variables being abc and def . proc - running on the processes rdb1 and rdb2 . mode - the function being run repeatedly. starttime - 9AM. endtime - not specified. period - the check to be run every 10 minutes. The line in dqcconfig.csv should be: action,params,proc,mode,starttime,endtime,period customcheck,`comp`vars!(0b;(`abc;`def)),`rdb1;`rdb2,repeat,09:00:00.000000000,0Wn,0D00:10:00 To add a check that compares two processes, the check function would have to return a mixed listed with three atoms. The first two being the same as above, and the third being a numeric value. The numeric value would be what is compared between the two processes. Below is a sample of a qscript named customcheck.q, with the function customcheck, written in pseudo-code for reference to compare two processes: \\d .dqc customcheck:{[variable1;variable2] $[variable1~variable2; (1b;\"Description if the function ran successfully\";count variable1); (0b;\"Description if the function failed to run\";avg variable2)] } Secondly, the line in dqcconfig.csv should be modified. As mentioned above, the params parameter would now have to be changed, and two additional dictionary keys would have to be added. As an example, if we were to run the function customcheck comparing hdb1 and hdb2 , with there being no difference allowed between the two results returned from the two processes, the line would be the following: action,params,proc,mode,starttime,endtime,period customcheck,`comp`compallow`compproc`vars!(1b;0;`hdb1;(`abc;`def)),`hdb2,repeat,09:00:00.000000000,0Wn,0D00:10:00 If we were to allow for 50% difference between the results returned from the two processes using the function customcheck, the line would be the following: action,params,proc,mode,starttime,endtime,period customcheck,`comp`compallow`compproc`vars!(1b;50;`hdb1;(`abc;`def)),`hdb2,repeat,09:00:00.000000000,0Wn,0D00:10:00","title":"Data Quality Checker (DQC)"},{"location":"Processes/#data-quality-engine-dqe","text":"The DQE process stores daily statistics of other TorQ processes.

New Custom Queries To add custom queries, create a new q file in /code/dqe. The new q script should be under the namespace dqe, and should contain the function. The function should return a dictionary, With the key being the function name, and the value being the statistic that the query should return. The value from the dictionary will be shown as the resvalue in the resultstab table. Below is a sample of a qscript named customquery.q, with the function customquery, written in pseudo-code for reference: \\d .dqe customquery:{[variable1;variable2] (enlist variable1)!enlist count variable2 } To use the function to run check, proceed to /appconfig/dqengineconfig.csv, and modify how you would want the check to be ran. As an example, to run the customquery above with the following settings - params - Variable being abc . proc - running on the process hdb1 . querytype - other as it is not a table starttime - 9AM The line in the config csv should be: query,params,proc,querytype,starttime customquery,`table`quote,`hdb1,other,09:00:00.000000000","title":"Data Quality Engine (DQE)"},{"location":"analyticslib/","text":"Analytics Library A set of analytical functions is provided for the simplification of common operations. This set of tools is targeted at new kdb+ developers or business users. Data visualization would be an example application of this library, as an effective visualization of data incurs various manipulations of data sets. For example, a user wishes to produce a 15 minute bucketed sample of a time series, and forward fill it, then pivot it. All of the above can be achieved with the functions defined below. General Usage These set of function are defined in the .al namespace. All of the functions below have an input parameter in the form of a dictionary. The specifics of each dictionary are detailed in the usage section of each function. This set of utilities also includes a general set of error traps which were designed to give informative errors specific to each function. For example if a dictionary has not been provided then the error would be: q).al.pivot[123] 'Input parameter must be a dictionary with keys: -table -by -piv -var These error traps and messages are to guide the user in the correct use of the utilities and are designed to be as informative as possible. ffill Usage This script contains the utility to dynamically forward fill a given table keyed by given columns. Input is a dictionary containing: table: Table to be forward filled by: List of column names to key the table (optional) keycols: List of columns names to be forward filled (optional) OR Table This utility is equivalent to: update fills col1, fills col2 ... by col2 from table If you have a large data set or just a table with multiple columns typing this statement out can be quite laborious. With this utility you simply specify the table or parameter dictionary and pass it to the function. This utility also has the added functionality of being able to forward fill mixed list columns, i.e. strings. Examples Example 1.1 By specifying the by condition in the input dictionary the function can forward fill keyed by specific column, for example: q)table time sym ask bid asize bsize a id ------------------------------------------ 00:00:38.184 AMD 121 12 3 30 a 1 00:01:25.332 AMD 121 3 3 30 b 4 00:09:37.574 AAPL 63 32 3 30 b 3 00:21:24.796 AAPL 63 12 4 00:38:39.521 AAPL 121 3 5 a 3 00:40:41.670 MSFT 63 3 4 20 c 4 00:48:08.048 MSFT 63 40 3 00:48:39.290 IBM 63 3 12 40 d 2 00:57:47.067 AAPL 24 3 30 2 01:08:00.945 AAPL 121 12 3 20 b 3 We can create the input dictionary in the following way to specify the by clause of the ffill utility: q)args:(`table`by)!(table;`sym) Passing this to the function we can see the result: q).al.ffill args time sym ask bid asize bsize a id ------------------------------------------ 00:00:38.184 AMD 121 12 3 30 a 1 00:01:25.332 AMD 121 3 3 30 b 4 00:09:37.574 AAPL 63 32 3 30 b 3 00:21:24.796 AAPL 63 32 12 30 b 4 00:38:39.521 AAPL 121 3 5 30 a 3 00:40:41.670 MSFT 63 3 4 20 c 4 00:48:08.048 MSFT 63 3 4 40 c 3 00:48:39.290 IBM 63 3 12 40 d 2 00:57:47.067 AAPL 121 24 3 30 a 2 01:08:00.945 AAPL 121 12 3 20 b 3 Example 1.2 By specifying the keycols condition in the input dictionary the function can forward fill only specific columns, for example: Using the data set below we can create an input specifying which column we want to forward fill: q)table time sym src price size mode ------------------------------------------------------ 2018.02.13D08:02:09.322000000 AAPL N 32 513 \"A\" 2018.02.13D08:03:23.511000000 AAPL N 32 344 \"\" 2018.02.13D08:06:35.424000000 AAPL N 32 1933 \"B\" 2018.02.13D08:13:03.067000000 AAPL N 76 1009 \"B\" 2018.02.13D08:15:09.130000000 AAPL O 43 5199 \"B\" 2018.02.13D08:22:21.528000000 AAPL N 76 427 \"A\" 2018.02.13D08:23:46.489000000 AAPL N 7918 \"B\" 2018.02.13D08:26:34.645000000 AAPL N 43 420 \"\" 2018.02.13D08:27:41.633000000 AAPL N 5391 \"A\" 2018.02.13D08:28:00.078000000 AAPL N 54 713 \"A\" 2018.02.13D08:28:39.200000000 AAPL N 8117 \"C\" 2018.02.13D08:32:21.651000000 AAPL N 43 178 \"A\" q)args:(`table`keycols)!(table;`price) q).al.ffill args time sym src price size mode ------------------------------------------------------ 2018.02.13D08:02:09.322000000 AAPL N 32 513 \"A\" 2018.02.13D08:03:23.511000000 AAPL N 32 344 \"\" 2018.02.13D08:06:35.424000000 AAPL N 32 1933 \"B\" 2018.02.13D08:13:03.067000000 AAPL N 76 1009 \"B\" 2018.02.13D08:15:09.130000000 AAPL O 43 5199 \"B\" 2018.02.13D08:22:21.528000000 AAPL N 76 427 \"A\" 2018.02.13D08:23:46.489000000 AAPL N 76 7918 \"B\" 2018.02.13D08:26:34.645000000 AAPL N 43 420 \"\" 2018.02.13D08:27:41.633000000 AAPL N 43 5391 \"A\" 2018.02.13D08:28:00.078000000 AAPL N 54 713 \"A\" 2018.02.13D08:28:39.200000000 AAPL N 54 8117 \"C\" 2018.02.13D08:32:21.651000000 AAPL N 43 178 \"A\" Note that without specifying the by condition the column was forward filled as it sits in the table.

An indepth explanation of how to pivot a table is available here . This is a modified version of code available on code.kx Usage This script contains the utility to pivot a table, specifying the keyed columns, the columns you wish to pivot around and the values you wish to expose. Note that this method always produces the last value for the grouping. To circumvent this you can do your own aggregation on the table before using the pivot function. For example you can create a column to calculate the sum: update totsum:sum price by sym,src from table and then pivot the data. This utility takes a dictionary as input with the following parameters: table: The table you want to pivot by: The keyed columns piv: The pivot columns var: The variables you want to see f: The function to create your column names (optional) g: The function to sort your column names (optional) The optional function f is a function of var and piv which creates column names for your pivoted table. The optional function g is a function of the keyed columns, piv and the return of f, which sorts the columns in ascending order. Examples Example 1.1 We have a table of quotes: q)quote date sym time side level price size ----------------------------------------------------- 2009.01.05 bafc 09:30:00.619 B 0 88.31803 96 2009.01.05 oljg 09:30:15.770 A 2 24.72941 14 2009.01.05 mgab 09:30:30.993 B 0 33.80173 2 2009.01.05 cflm 09:30:45.457 A 4 13.08412 98 2009.01.05 jgjm 09:31:00.668 B 0 80.2705 26 2009.01.05 cnkk 09:31:15.988 A 1 23.27025 38 .. We can key the table by date,sym and time, pivot around both side and level showing price and size at each time. The input dictionary is created in the following way: args:(`table`by`piv`var)!(quote;`date`sym`time;`side`level;`price`size); Here we are specifying the arguments for f and g as the default functions: // create _ separated column headers f:{[v;P] `$\"_\" sv' string (v,()) cross P} // return the headers in order g:{[k;P;c] k,asc c} The pivot function is then called and the output can be seen below: q).al.pivot[args] date sym time | price_A_0 price_A_1 price_A_2 price_A_3 price_A_4 price_B_0 price_B_1 price_B_2 price_B_3 price_B_4 size_A_0 size_A_1 size_A_2 size_A_3 size_A_4 size_B_0 size_B_1 size_B_2 size_B_3 size_B_4 ----------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2009.01.05 bafc 09:30:00.619| 88.31803 96 2009.01.05 bafc 10:05:30.395| 60.77025 73 2009.01.05 bafc 10:11:00.990| 0.03195086 71 2009.01.05 bafc 10:41:00.031| 68.8886 60 2009.01.05 bafc 10:41:15.924| 4.926275 56 2009.01.05 bafc 11:06:30.361| 84.28182 10 2009.01.05 bafc 11:52:30.361| 8.733561 7 .. Example 1.2 We have the following table showing some FX data: q)t sym time price size lp region ----------------------------------- EURGBP 09:00 1 870 UBS LON EURGBP 09:07 7 296 BARX LON EURGBP 09:19 3 850 BARX LON EURGBP 09:27 1 540 HSBC NYC EURUSD 09:31 4 995 UBS LON AUDUSD 09:38 0 396 HSBC NYC EURUSD 09:41 6 152 UBS LON EURUSD 09:42 4 317 HSBC NYC EURGBP 09:43 6 670 HSBC LON EURGBP 09:47 7 345 BARX NYC .. We want to see the different prices each liquidity provider has for each currency pair. For this we need to pivot the table t by sym around the lp's to show the various prices. We first create out parameter dictionary: args:(`table`by`piv`var)!(t;`sym;`lp;`price`size) We then pass the dictionary into the pivot utility: q).al.pivot[args] sym | price_BARX price_HSBC price_UBS ------| ------------------------------- EURGBP| 7 1 1 EURUSD| 8 4 4 AUDUSD| 4 0 0 Another way to manipulate the same data would be to key the table by sym and lp (i.e. currency pair and liquidity provider) and pivot by region to show both price and size. Setting up this dictionary and passing it to the pivot function we see the result below: q)args:(`table`by`piv`v)!(t;`sym`lp;`region;`price`size) q).al.pivot[args] sym lp | price_LON price_NYC size_LON size_NYC -----------| ------------------------------------- EURGBP UBS | 1 3 870 32 EURGBP BARX| 7 7 296 345 EURGBP HSBC| 6 1 670 540 EURUSD UBS | 4 1 995 494 AUDUSD HSBC| 5 0 879 396 EURUSD HSBC| 1 4 459 317 EURUSD BARX| 6 8 62 299 AUDUSD BARX| 4 2 817 716 AUDUSD UBS | 3 0 744 217 intervals The intervals.q utility in the .al namespace is used to output a list of equally spaced intervals between given start and end points. Usage Input is a dictionary containing: start: Starting integer number end: Ending integer number interval: Interval spacing between values round: Toggle rounding to nearest specified interval (optional) Parameters should be passed in the form of a dictionary, where start and end must be of the same type and interval can be either a long int or of the same type as start and end (i.e if start:09:00 and end:12:00, and intervals of 5 minutes were required interval could equal 00:05 or 5) Allowed data types are: date month time minute second timestamp timespan integer short long Example Using minute datatype: q)params:`start`end`interval`round!(09:32;12:00;00:30;0b) q).al.intervals[params] 09:32 10:02 10:32 11:02 11:32 or with round applied. q)params:`start`end`interval`round!(09:32;12:00;00:30;1b) q).al.intervals[params] 09:30 10:00 10:30 11:00 11:30 12:00 by default round is set to 1b, hence the result above can be obtained without inputting a value for round via: q)params:`start`end`interval!(09:32;12:00;00:30) q).al.intervals[params] 09:30 10:00 10:30 11:00 11:30 12:00 q)params:`start`end`interval!(2001.04.07;2001.05.01;5) q).al.intervals[params] 2001.04.05 2001.04.10 2001.04.15 2001.04.20 2001.04.25 2001.04.30 and without rounding q)params:`start`end`interval`round!(2001.04.07;2001.05.01;5;0b) q).al.intervals[params] 2001.04.07 2001.04.12 2001.04.17 2001.04.22 2001.04.27 q)params:`start`end`interval!(00:20:30 01:00:00 00:10:00) q).al.intervals[params] 00:20:00 00:30:00 00:40:00 00:50:00 01:00:00 q)params:`start`end`interval`round!(00:20:30 01:00:00 00:10:00) q).al.intervals[params] 00:20:30 00:30:30 00:40:30 00:50:30 q)params:`start`end`interval!(00:01:00.000000007;00:05:00.000000001;50000000000) q).al.intervals[params] 0D00:00:50.000000000 0D00:01:40.000000000 0D00:02:30.000000000 0D00:03:20.000000000 0D00:04:10.000000000 0D00:05:00.000000000 rack The rack utility gives the user the ability to create a rack table (the cross product of distinct values at the input). Usage Input is be a dictionary containing: table: Keyed or unkeyed in memory table keycols: The columns of the table you want to create the rack from. base: This is an additional table, against which the rack can be created (optional) timeseries.start: Start time to create a timeseries rack (optional) timeseries.end: End time to create a time series rack (optional) timeseries.interval: The interval for the time racking (optional) timeseries.round: Should rounding be carried out when creating the timeseries (optional) fullexpansion: Determines whether the required columns of input table will be expanded themselves or not. (optional, default is 0b) A timeseries is optional but if it is required then start, end, and interval must be specified as a dictionary called 'timeseries' (round remains optional with a default value of 1b). Keyed tables can be provided, these will be unkeyed by the function and crossed as standard unkeyed tables. Full expansion in this case refers to the level to which the data is crossed with itself and the user-defined intervals. For example were full expansion disabled then the table would be crossed with the user defined intervals and then crossed with the base. If full expansion is enabled then all of the table columns are crossed with each other before being crossed with the intervals and then the base. Allowing for a more in depth and detailed representation of the data.

It does not replace the main body of documentation, and ordering is presumed order-of-relevance. The below uses the default configuration of TorQ and TorQ Finance Starter Pack, though a lot of it is configurable. It's probably a good idea to read the About section at least. Debugging Running Processes Each TorQ process has several internal tables which are useful. Connect to these using standard tools (qcon, an IDE etc.). Default user:pass of admin:admin will usually work. .usage.usage .usage.usage is used to track the queries that are executed against the process and is usually the first place to look for problems. Data is stored in memory for 24 hours and also persisted to disk in a usage_* file which is rolled daily. Every query and timer function call is logged, except for `.u.upd or `upd messages as this would bloat the log file considerably. Queries are logged before they are executed (status=\"b\") and after (status=\"c\" (complete) or status=\"e\" (error)). If a query blocks a process and makes it unresponsive, it will have an entry (status=\"b\") in the log file on disk. .usage.usage can be queried like any other kdb+ table to diagnose problems e.g. 100 sublist `timer xdesc .usage.usage select from .usage.usage where time within ... Note that this table is not especially helpful for gateway queries which are executed in an async call back manner. The gateway part of the request will (should) usually have a very short run time so the back end services should be interrogated to see what the slow parts are. More info on usage logs. .timer.timer .timer.timer shows information about the timer calls which are scheduled / have been run. Pay attention to the \"active\" field- if a timer call fails it will be removed from the timer (active=0b). To avoid this if required, wrap the function being executed by the timer in an error trap in the standard way. Use .timer.timer in combination with .usage.usage to work out if there are slow running/too frequent timers which are causing problems. More info. Log Files Log files are stored in the log directory specified by the environment variable KDBLOG. Each process creates 3 log files: - an out log (out_ ) with standard log messages - an error log file (err_ ) with errors - a usage log file (usage_* ) with a log of every request that hits the process. The error log file should be empty. Don't ignore the out_ log file, there is a lot of information in there which can be used to debug. One thing that is a bit awkward is that if there is an error then the error log message timestamp has to be matched off against the out message log messages. You can force a process to write to a single log file if the process is started with the -onelog command line parameter. .clients.clients This shows inbound connections (connections created into this process). It may have interesting information about connection open/close. If it has a lot of rows it means some clients are connecting and disconnecting frequently. More info. .servers.SERVERS This shows outbound connections (connections created by this process to other processes). It's useful for tracking connections which have died. Starting, Stopping and Debugging Processes 95% of TorQ installations in production run on Linux, and the below applies to Linux only. Use the torq.sh script to start/stop/debug processes.

Modifying Existing Installations We always try to esnure new versions of TorQ are backwardly compatible. Try to avoid modifying TorQ itself and instead make application specific modifications. The installation script deploys TorQ in a structure which keeps TorQ and the application separate, and this should be adhered to whenever possible. To modify the config for a process, do it either in the config directory or as a command line start up parameter as- almost all config variables that are defined in a config file and exists in a non-root namespace can be overridden from the command line. To make a process load additional files, you can: append the additional files to the -load parameter on the start line append a set of directories of files using -loaddir on the start line place the files in one of the directories that is loaded by default on start up Start line modifications can be made in process.csv and will be picked up by torq.sh. Of these approaches, the latter is probably preferable. Adding Custom Processes When adding custom processes to TorQ it is important to understand the significance of proctype . In a nutshell, only processes which do exactly the same thing should have the same proctype. If two processes do roughly the same thing then -parentproctype can be used to share common functionality. Also there isn't any formal association between proctype and code name file name e.g. a process that loads code/processes/rdb.q can have any proctype we like. How TorQ manages connections is important. Avoid using hopen, use TorQ connection management. TorQ uses the fail fast principle (if you are going to fail, may as well do it as quickly as possible). This helps avoid processes starting up in inconsistent or unexpected states. If running a process with the -debug option, add the -stop or -trap options to stop at, or trap and continue through, start up errors. Code is loaded in a specific order, which can be overridden. To determine the order, inspect the bottom of the torq.q script (the last 100 lines or so).

Queries are logged before they are executed (status=\"b\") and after (status=\"c\" (complete) or status=\"e\" (error)). If a query blocks a process and makes it unresponsive, it will have an entry (status=\"b\") in the log file on disk. .usage.usage can be queried like any other kdb+ table to diagnose problems e.g. 100 sublist `timer xdesc .usage.usage select from .usage.usage where time within ...

The location is done either statically using the process.csv file or dynamically using a discovery service. It is recommended to use the discovery service as it allows the process to be notified as new processes become available. The main configuration variable is .servers.CONNECTIONS, which dictates which process type(s) to create connections to. .servers.startup[] must be called to initialise the connections. When connections are closed, the connection table is automatically updated. The process can be set to periodically retry connections. Process Attributes Each process can report a set of attributes. When process A connects to process B, process A will try to retrieve the attributes of process B. The attributes are defined by the result of the .proc.getattributes function, which is by default an empty dictionary. Attributes are used to retrieve more detail about the capabilities of each process, rather than relying on the broad brush process type and process name categorization. Attributes can be used for intelligent query routing. Potential fields for attributes include: range of data contained in the process; available tables; instrument universe; physical location; any other fields of relevance. Connection Passwords The password used by a process to connect to external processes is retrieved using the .servers.loadpassword function call. By default, this will read the password from a txt file contained in $KDBCONFIG/passwords. A default password can be used, which is overridden by one for the process type, which is itself overridden by one for the process name. For greater security, the .servers.loadpassword function should be modified. Some non-torq processes require a username and password to allow connection. These will be stored in a passwords dictionary. Passing the host and port of a process into this dictionary will return the full connection string if it is present within the dictionary. If however it is not present in the dictionary then the default username and password will be returned. Retrieving and Using Handles A function .servers.getservers is supplied to return a table of handle information. .servers.getservers takes five parameters: type-or-name: whether the lookup is to be done by type or name (can be either proctype or procname); types-or-names: the types or names to retrieve e.g. hdb; required-attributes: the dictionary of attributes to match on; open-dead-connections: whether to re-open dead connections; only-one: whether we only require one handle. So for example if 3 services of the supplied type are registered, and we have an open handle to 1 of them, the open handle will be returned and the others left closed irrespective of the open-dead-connections parameter. .servers.getservers will compare the required parameters with the available parameters for each handle.

Customisations are contained in q scripts (.q files), which define functions and variables which modify the behaviour of a process. Every q process can load a single q script, or a directory containing q scripts and/or q data files. Hooks are provided to enable the programmer to apply a custom function to each entry point of the process (.z.p*), to be invoked on the timer (.z.ts) or when a variable in the top level namespace is amended (.z.vs). By default none of these hooks are implemented. We provide a codebase and a single main script, torq.q. torq.q is essentially a wrapper for bespoke functionality which can load other scripts/directories, or can be sourced from other scripts. Whenever possible, torq.q should be invoked directly and used to load other scripts as required. torq.q will: ensure the environment is set up correctly; define some common utility functions (such as logging); execute process management tasks, such as discovering the name and type of the process, and re-directing output to log files; load configuration; load the shared code based; set up the message handlers; load any required bespoke scripts. The behavior of torq.q is modified by both command line parameters and configuration. We have tried to keep as much as possible in configuration files, but if the parameter either has a global effect on the process or if it is required to be known before the configuration is read, then it is a command line parameter. Installing TorQ A guide on how to install TorQ using installation script here . Using torq.q torq.q can be invoked directly from the command line and be set to source a specified file or directory. torq.q requires the 5 environment variables to be set (see section envvar). If using a unix environment, this can be done with the setenv.sh script. To start a process in the foreground without having to modify any other files (e.g. process.csv) you need to specify the type and name of the process as parameters. An example is below. $ . setenv.sh $ q torq.q -debug -proctype testproc -procname test1 To specify the parent process type, do: $ q torq.q -debug -parentproctype testparentproc -proctype testproc -procname test1 To load a file, do: $ q torq.q -load myfile.q -debug -proctype testproc -procname test1 It can also be sourced from another script. If this is the case, some of the variables can be overridden, and the usage information can be modified or extended. Any variable that has a definition like below can be overridden from the loading script. myvar:@[value;`myvar;1 2 3] The available command line parameters are: Cmd Line Param Description -procname x -proctype y The process name and process type -parentproctype x The parent process type -procfile x The name of the file to get the process information from -load x [y..z] The files or database directory to load -loaddir x [y..z] Load all .q, .k files in specified directories -localtime Sets processes running in local time rather than GMT for log messages, timer calls etc. The change is backwards compatible; without -localtime flag the process will print logs etc. in GMT but can also have a different .z.P -trap Any errors encountered during initialization when loading external files will be caught and logged, processing will continue -stop Stop loading the file if an error is encountered but do not exit -noredirect Do not redirect std out/std err to a file (useful for debugging) -noredirectalias Do not create an alias for the log files (aliases drop any suffix e.g. timestamp suffix) -noconfig Do not load configuration -nopi Reset the definition of .z.pi to the initial value (useful for debugging) -debug Equivalent to [-nopi -noredirect] -usage Print usage info and exit -onelog Writes all messages to stdout log file, note non-trapped errors will still be written to stderr log file -test x Use for unit testing. Pass the location of tests directory In addition any process variable in a namespace (.*.*) can be overridden from the command line. Any value supplied on the command line will take priority over any other predefined value (.e.g. in a configuration or wrapper). Variable names should be supplied with full qualification e.g. -.servers.HOPENTIMEOUT 5000. Using torq.sh torq.sh is a script that runs processes in torq with added functionality, one key enhancement is all the process configuration is now in one place. The default process file is located in $KDBCONFIG/process.csv. This script is only available on Linux. It requires environment variables to be set, similar to torq.q. A usage statement for the script can be seen by running the following in a unix environment: ./torq.sh . Environment Variables Five environment variables are required: Environment Variable Description KDBCONFIG The base configuration directory KDBCODE The base code directory KDBLOGS Where standard out/error and usage logs are written KDBHTML Contains HTML files KDBLIB Contains supporting library files torq.q will check for these and exit if they are not set. If torq.q is being sourced from another script, the required environment variables can be extended by setting .proc.envvars before loading torq.q. Process Identification At the crux of AquaQ TorQ is how processes identify themselves. This is defined by two required variables - .proc.proctype and .proc.procname which are the type and name of the process respectively. An optional variable parentproctype allows an inital codebase and configuration to be loaded. The two required values determine the code base and configuration loaded, and how they are connected to by other processes. If both of the required variables are not defined, TorQ will attempt to use the port number a process was started on to determine the code base and configuration loaded. The most important of these is the proctype. It is up to the user to define at what level to specify a process type. For example, in a production environment it would be valid to specify processes of type \u201chdb\u201d (historic database) and \u201crdb\u201d (real time database). It would also be valid to segregate a little more granularly based on approximate functionality, for example \u201chdbEMEA\u201d and \u201chdbAmericas\u201d. In this example it may be sensible to set the parentproctype as \"hdb\" and putting all shared code in the \"hdb\" configuration to be loaded first with the region-specific configuration being loaded after. The actual functionality of a process can be defined more specifically, but this will be discussed later. The procname value is used solely for identification purposes. A process can determine its type and name in a number of ways: From the process file in the default location of $KDBCONFIG/process.csv; From the process file defined using the command line parameter -procfile; From the port number it is started on, by referring to the process file for further process details; Using the command line parameters -proctype and -procname; By defining .proc.proctype and .proc.procname in a script which loads torq.q. For options 4 and 5, both parameters must be defined using that method or neither will be used (the values will be read from the process file). For option 3, TorQ will check the process file for any entries where the port matches the port number it has been started on, and deduce it\u2019s proctype and procname based on this port number and the corresponding hostname entry. The process file has format as below. aquaq$ cat config/process.csv host,port,proctype,procname,U,localtime,g,T,w,load,startwithall,extras,qcmd aquaq,9997,rdb,rdb_europe_1,appconfig/passwords/accesslist.txt,1,1,3,,${KDBCODE}/processes/rdb.q,1,,q aquaq,9998,hdb,hdb_europe_1,appconfig/passwords/accesslist.txt,1,1,60,4000,${KDBHDB},1,,q aquaq,9999,hdb,hdb_europe_2,appconfig/passwords/accesslist.txt,1,1,60,4000,${KDBHDB},1,,q The process will read the file and try to identify itself based on the host and port it is started on. The host can either be the value returned by .z.h, or the ip address of the server. If the process can not automatically identify itself it will exit, unless proctype and procname were both passed in as command line parameters. If both of these parameters are passed in then default configuration settings will be used.

Running processes using torq.sh torq.sh is able to start or stop processes seperately, in a batch or all at once. Before a process is started/stopped the script will check that the process is not already running before attempting to start/stop a process, a time of when this is executed is printed to screen. $ ./torq.sh start rdb1 hdb1 tickerplant1 15:42:00 | Starting rdb1... 15:42:00 | hdb1 already running 15:42:00 | Starting tickerplant1... $ ./torq.sh stop all 15:46:19 | Shutting down hdb1... 15:46:19 | Shutting down hdb2... A status summary table of all the processes can be printed to screen, the summary provides information on the time the process was checked, process name, status and the port number and PID of that process. $ ./torq.sh summary TIME | PROCESS | STATUS | PORT | PID 11:33:59 | discovery1 | up | 41001 | 14426 11:33:59 | tickerplant1 | down | It is possible to view the underlying start code for all processes.

Note it is only possible to start one process at a time in debug mode. $ ./torq.sh debug tickerplant1 If a process name not present in the process.csv is used, the input process name will return as an invalid input. To see a list of all the processes in the process.csv see below. $ ./torq.sh procs A different process file can be used with this script from the command line. The argument following the csv flag needs to be a full path to the process.csv. $ ./torq.sh start all -csv ${KDBAPPCONFIG}/process.csv To add/override the default values in the g, T, w, or extras column the extras flag can be used in this script. $ ./torq.sh start rdb1 -extras -T 60 -w 4000 $ ./torq.sh start sort1 -extras -s -3 Using the Code Profiler with torq.sh KDB 4.0 includes an experimental built-in call-stack snapshot primitive that allows building a sampling profiler. The profiler uses the new function .Q.prf0 . Requirements and documentation of the new code profiler by kx can be found here . Assuming a process is running, you can run the code below as an example in the command line. Note that this top function currently only allows a single process as an argument and multiple processes is not currently supported. $ ./torq.sh top rdb1 This uses the top.q script given by kx (description found here ) which will show an automatically updated display of functions most heavily contributing to the running time. The display has the following fields: Field Description self the percentage of time spent in the function itself total percentage of time spent in the function including all descendants name the name of the function file the file path where the function is located Logging By default, each process will redirect output to a standard out log and a standard error log, and create aliases for them. These will be rolled at midnight on a daily basis. They are all written to the $KDBLOGS directory. The log files created are: Log File Description out_[procname]_[date].log Timestamped out log err_[procname]_[date].log Timestamped error log out_[procname].log Alias to current log log err_[procname].log Alias to current error log The date suffix can be overridden by modifying the .proc.logtimestamp function and sourcing torq.q from another script. This could, for example, change the suffixing to a full timestamp. In the case where -onelog is flagged TorQ will attempt to redirect all output to the out log file, unfortunately this is not perfect. TorQ uses \\1 and \\2 to redirect stderr and stdout, onelog only overrides handled errors to the \\1 redirect. This is because there are issuses with redirecting both to the same file, (the ordering of messages will be incorrect) the issue is with KDB+ rather than with TorQ. Because of this errors that are raised by KDB+ and unhandled are still directed to the err log file because \\1 and \\2 cannot be redirected to the same file. Configuration Loading Default Configuration Loading Default process configuration is contained in q scripts, and stored in the $KDBCONFIG /settings directory. Each process tries to load all the configuration it can find and will attempt to load three configuration files in the below order:- default.q: default configuration loaded by all processes. In a standard installation this should contain the superset of customisable configuration, including comments. [parentproctype].q: configuration for a specific parent process type (only if parentproctype specified). [proctype].q: configuration for a specific process type. [procname].q: configuration for a specific named process. The only one which should always be present is default.q. Each of the other scripts can contain a subset of the configuration variables, which will override anything loaded previously. Application Configuration Loading Application specific configuration can be stored in a user defined directory and made visible to TorQ by setting the $KDBAPPCONFIG environment variable. If $KDBAPPCONFIG is set, then TorQ will search the $KDBAPPCONFIG/settings directory and load all configuration it can find. Application configuration will be loaded after all default configuration in the following order:- default.q: Application default configuration loaded by all processes. [[parentproctype]]{}.q : Application specific configuration for a specific parent process type (only if parentproctype specified). [[proctype]]{}.q: Application specific configuration for a specific process type. [[procname]]{}.q: Appliction specific configuration for a specific named process. All loaded configuration will override anything loaded previously. None of the above scripts are required to be present and can contain a subset of the default configuration variables from the default configuration directory. All configuration is loaded before code. Application Dependency TorQ will automatically check application version and dependency information. TorQ will check the $KDBAPPCONFIG directory for a dependency.csv file. This file should contain information in the format: app version dependency app0 1.0.0 app1 1.1.1;app2 2.1.0 TorQ will also search the $KDBCONFIG directory for the TorQ dependency.csv file. If any of the dependency versions exceed application versions, TorQ will exit and log the error. If no dependency files are supplied, TorQ will run as normal. However, if only an application dependency file is supplied, TorQ will exit and log the error. Each version number can be up to 5 digits in length, separated by '.' and the current kdb+ version will be automatically added with the format major.minor.yyyy.mm.dd Code Loading Code is loaded from the $KDBCODE directory. There is also a common codebase, a codebase for each process type, and a code base for each process name, contained in the following directories and loaded in this order: $KDBCODE/common: shared codebase loaded by all processes; $KDBCODE/[parentproctype]: code for a specific parent process type (only if parentproctype specified); $KDBCODE/[proctype]: code for a specific process type; $KDBCODE/[procname]: code for a specific process name; For any directory loaded, the load order can be specified by adding order.txt to the directory. order.txt dictates the order that files in the directory are loaded. If a file is not in order.txt, it will still be loaded but after all the files listed in order.txt have been loaded. In addition to loading code form $KDBCODE, application specific code can be saved in a user defined directory with the same structure as above, and made visible to TorQ by setting the $KDBAPPCODE environment variable. If this environment variable is set, TorQ will load codebase in the following order. $KDBCODE/common: shared codebase loaded by all processes; $KDBAPPCODE/common: application specific code shared by all processes; $KDBCODE/[parentproctype]: code for a specific parent process type (only if parentproctype specified); $KDBAPPCODE/[parentproctype]: application specific code for a specific parent process type (only if parentproctype specified); $KDBCODE/[proctype]: code for a specific process type; $KDBAPPCODE/[proctype]: application specific code for a specific process type; $KDBCODE/[procname]: code for a specific process name; $KDBAPPCODE/[procname]: application specific code for a specific process name; Additional directories can be loaded using the -loaddir command line parameter. Initialization Errors Initialization errors can be handled in different ways. The default action is any initialization error causes the process to exit. This is to enable fail-fast type conditions, where it is better for a process to fail entirely and immediately than to start up in an indeterminate state. This can be overridden with the -trap or -stop command line parameters. With -trap, the process will catch the error, log it, and continue. This is useful if, for example, the error is encountered loading a file of stored procedures which may not be invoked and can be reloaded later. With -stop the process will halt at the point of the error but will not exit. Both -stop and -trap are useful for debugging.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#getting-started","text":"kdb+ is very customisable. Customisations are contained in q scripts (.q files), which define functions and variables which modify the behaviour of a process. Every q process can load a single q script, or a directory containing q scripts and/or q data files. Hooks are provided to enable the programmer to apply a custom function to each entry point of the process (.z.p*), to be invoked on the timer (.z.ts) or when a variable in the top level namespace is amended (.z.vs). By default none of these hooks are implemented. We provide a codebase and a single main script, torq.q. torq.q is essentially a wrapper for bespoke functionality which can load other scripts/directories, or can be sourced from other scripts. Whenever possible, torq.q should be invoked directly and used to load other scripts as required. torq.q will: ensure the environment is set up correctly; define some common utility functions (such as logging); execute process management tasks, such as discovering the name and type of the process, and re-directing output to log files; load configuration; load the shared code based; set up the message handlers; load any required bespoke scripts. The behavior of torq.q is modified by both command line parameters and configuration. We have tried to keep as much as possible in configuration files, but if the parameter either has a global effect on the process or if it is required to be known before the configuration is read, then it is a command line parameter.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#installing-torq","text":"A guide on how to install TorQ using installation script here .","title":"Installing TorQ"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#using-torqq","text":"torq.q can be invoked directly from the command line and be set to source a specified file or directory. torq.q requires the 5 environment variables to be set (see section envvar).

This is defined by two required variables - .proc.proctype and .proc.procname which are the type and name of the process respectively. An optional variable parentproctype allows an inital codebase and configuration to be loaded. The two required values determine the code base and configuration loaded, and how they are connected to by other processes. If both of the required variables are not defined, TorQ will attempt to use the port number a process was started on to determine the code base and configuration loaded. The most important of these is the proctype. It is up to the user to define at what level to specify a process type. For example, in a production environment it would be valid to specify processes of type \u201chdb\u201d (historic database) and \u201crdb\u201d (real time database). It would also be valid to segregate a little more granularly based on approximate functionality, for example \u201chdbEMEA\u201d and \u201chdbAmericas\u201d. In this example it may be sensible to set the parentproctype as \"hdb\" and putting all shared code in the \"hdb\" configuration to be loaded first with the region-specific configuration being loaded after. The actual functionality of a process can be defined more specifically, but this will be discussed later. The procname value is used solely for identification purposes. A process can determine its type and name in a number of ways: From the process file in the default location of $KDBCONFIG/process.csv; From the process file defined using the command line parameter -procfile; From the port number it is started on, by referring to the process file for further process details; Using the command line parameters -proctype and -procname; By defining .proc.proctype and .proc.procname in a script which loads torq.q. For options 4 and 5, both parameters must be defined using that method or neither will be used (the values will be read from the process file). For option 3, TorQ will check the process file for any entries where the port matches the port number it has been started on, and deduce it\u2019s proctype and procname based on this port number and the corresponding hostname entry. The process file has format as below. aquaq$ cat config/process.csv host,port,proctype,procname,U,localtime,g,T,w,load,startwithall,extras,qcmd aquaq,9997,rdb,rdb_europe_1,appconfig/passwords/accesslist.txt,1,1,3,,${KDBCODE}/processes/rdb.q,1,,q aquaq,9998,hdb,hdb_europe_1,appconfig/passwords/accesslist.txt,1,1,60,4000,${KDBHDB},1,,q aquaq,9999,hdb,hdb_europe_2,appconfig/passwords/accesslist.txt,1,1,60,4000,${KDBHDB},1,,q The process will read the file and try to identify itself based on the host and port it is started on. The host can either be the value returned by .z.h, or the ip address of the server. If the process can not automatically identify itself it will exit, unless proctype and procname were both passed in as command line parameters. If both of these parameters are passed in then default configuration settings will be used.

This is found at $KDBCODE/handlers. Much of the code is derived from Simon Garland\u2019s contributions to code.kx . Every external interaction with a process goes through a message handler, and these can be modified to, for example, log or restrict access. Passing through a bespoke function defined in a message handler will add extra processing time and therefore latency to the message. All the customizations we have provided aim to minimise additional latency, but if a bespoke process is latency sensitive then some or all of the customizations could be switched off. We would argue though that generally it is better to switch on all the message handler functions which provide diagnostic information, as for most non-latency sensitive processes (HDBs, Gateways, some RDBs etc.) the extra information upon failure is worth the cost. The message handlers can be globally switched off by setting .proc.loadhandlers to 0b in the configuration file.

It is a modified version of the logusage.q script on code.kx. In its most verbose mode it will log information to an in-memory table (.usage.usage) and an on-disk ASCII file, both before and after every client interaction and function executed on the timer. These choices were made because: logging to memory enables easy interrogation of client interaction; logging to disk allows persistence if the process fails or locks up. ASCII text files allow interrogation using OS tools such as vi, grep or tail; logging before a query ensures any query that adversely effects the process is definitely captured, as well as capturing some state information before the query execution; logging after a query captures the time taken, result set size and resulting state; logging timer calls ensures a full history of what the process is actually doing. Also, timer call performance degradation over time is a common source of problems in kdb+ systems.

Null for rows with status of b or e error Error message controlaccess.q controlaccess.q is used to restrict client access to the process. It is modified version of controlaccess.q from code.kx. The script allows control of several aspects: the host/ip address of the servers which are allowed to access the process; definition of three user groups (default, poweruser and superuser) and the actions each group is allowed to do; the group(s) each user is a member of, and any additional actions an individual user is allowed/disallowed outside of the group permissions; the maximum size of the result set returned to a client. The access restrictions are loaded from csv files. The permissions files are stored in $KDBCONFIG/permissions. File Description *_hosts.csv Contains hostname and ip address (patterns) for servers which are allowed or disallowed access. If a server is not found in the list, it is disallowed *_users.csv Contains individual users and the user groups they are are a member of *_functions.csv Contains individual functions and whether each user group is allowed to execute them. ; separated user list enables functions to be allowed by individual users The permissions files are loaded using a similar hierarchical approach as for the configuration and code loading. Three files can be provided- default_.csv, [proctype]_.csv, and [procname]_.csv. All of the files will be loaded, but permissions for the same entity (hostpattern, user, or function) defined in [procname]_.csv will override those in [proctype]_.csv which will in turn override [procname]_.csv. When a client makes a query which is refused by the permissioning layer, an error will be raised and logged in .usuage.usage if it is enabled. trackclients.q trackclients.q is used to track client interaction. It is a slightly modified version of trackclients.q from code.kx, and extends the functionality to handle interaction with the discovery service. Whenever a client opens a connection to the q process, it will be registered in the .clients.clients table. Various details are logged, but from a diagnostic perspective the most important information are the client details, the number of queries it has run, the last time it ran a query, the number of failed queries and the cumulative size of results returned to it. trackservers.q trackservers.q is used to register and maintain handles to external servers. It is a heavily modified version of trackservers.q from code.kx. It is explained more in section connectionmanagement. zpsignore.q zpsignore.q is used to check incoming async calls for certain patterns and to bypass all further message handler checks for messages matching the pattern. This is useful for handling update messages published to a process from a data source. writeaccess.q writeaccess.q is used to restrict client write access to data within a process. The script uses the reval function, released in KDB+ 3.3, to prevent client queries from modifying any data in place. At present only queries in the form of strings are passed through the reval function. Additonally the script disables any form of HTTP access. If using versions of KDB+ prior to 3.3, this feature must be disabled. An attempt to use this feature on previous KDB+ versions will result in an error and the relevant process exiting. permissions.q permissions.q is used to control client access to a server process. It allows: Access control via username/password access, either in combination with the -u/U process flags or in place of them. Definition of user groups, which control variable access. Definition of user roles, which allow control over function execution. Deeper control over table subsetting through the use of \u201cvirtual tables\u201d, using enforced where clauses. Access restriction in TorQ can be enabled on all processes, each of which can then load the default.q in $KDBCONFIG/permissions/, which adds users, groups and roles allowing standard operation of TorQ. The admin user and role by default can access all functions, and each of the system processes has access only to the required system functions. Permissions are enabled or disabled on a per-process basis through setting .pm.enabled as 1b or 0b at process load (set to 0b by default). A permissioned process can safely interact with a non-permissioned process while still controlling access to itself. The access schema consists of 7 control tables: Name Descriptions user Username, locality, encryption type and password hash usergroup User and their group. userrole User and role. functiongroup Functions and their group function Function names, the roles which can access them, and a lambda checking the parameters those roles can use. access Variable names, the groups which can access them, and the read or write access level. virtualtable Virtual table name, main table name, and the where clause it enforces on access to that table. In addition to groupinfo and roleinfo tables, which contain the group/role name and a string describing each group and role. A user can belong to multiple groups, and have multiple roles. In particular the schema supports group hierarchy, where a user group can be listed as a user in the group table, and inherit all the permissions from another other group, effectively inheriting the second group itself. Note that a group cannot have the same name as an individual user. A user belonging to a group listed in the access table will have the specified level of access (read or write) to that group\u2019s variables, e.g. Table Group Level quote headtrader write trade juniortrader read Here, users in headtrader will have write access to the quote table, while juniortrader group has read access to the trade table. If headtraders have been set to inherit the juniortrader group, they will also have read access to trade. Note that read access is distinct from write access. Headtraders in this circumstance do not have implicit read access to the quote table. This control is for direct name access only. Selects, execs and updates are controlled via the function table, as below. The permissions script can be set to have permissive mode enabled with permissivemode:1b (disabled by default). When enabled at script loading, this bypasses access checks on variables which are not listed in the access table, effectively auto-allowlisting any variables not listed in the access table for all users, which may be useful in partly restricted development environments. Function access is controlled through non-hierarchical roles. A user attempting to run a named function will have their access checked against the function table through their role, for example, trying to run a function timedata[syms;bkttype], which selects from a table by a time bucket type bkttype on xbar: Function Role Param. Check timedata quant {1b} timedata normal user {x[`bkttype] in `hh} select quant {1b} The parameter check in the third column must be a lambda accepting a dictionary of parameters and their values, which can then return a boolean if some parameter condition is met. Here, any normal user must have their bucket type as an hour. If they try anything else, the function is not permitted. This could be extended to restriction to certain syms as well, in this example, the quant can run this function with any parameters. Anything passed to the param. check function returns 1b. A quant having general select access is listed as having 1b in the param. check. Further restriction of data can be achieved with virtual tables, via which users can be restricted to having a certain subset of data from a main table available. To avoid the need to replicate a potentially large subset of a table into a separately-controlled variable, this is done through pointing to the table under a different name via a where clause, e.g. Virtual Table Table Where Clause trade_lse trade ,(in;`src;\u201cL\u201d) quote_new quote ,(>;`time;(-;`.z.p;01:00)) When a select from trade_lse is performed, a select on trade is modified to contain the where clause above. Access to virtual tables can be controlled identically to access to real tables through the access table. If the process is given the flag \u201c-public 1\u201d, it will run in public access mode. This allows a user to log in without a password and be given the publicuser role and membership of the public group, which can be configured as any other group or role. The permissions control has a default size restriction of 2GB, set (as bytes) on .pm.maxsize. This is a global restriction and is not affected by user permissions. Adding to the groups and roles is handled by the functions: adduser[`user;`locality;`hash type; md5\"password\"] removeuser[`user] addgroup[`groupname; \"description\"] removegroup[`groupname] addrole[`rolename; \"description\"] removerole[`rolename] addtogroup[`user;`groupname] removefromgroup[`user; `groupname] assignrole[`user; `rolename] unassignrole[`user; `rolename] addfunction[`function; `functiongroup] removefunction[`function; `functiongroup] grantaccess[`variable; `groupname; `level] revokeaccess[`variable; `groupname; `level] grantfunction[`function; `rolename; {paramCheckFn}] revokefunction[`function; `rolename] createvirtualtable[`vtablename; `table; ,(whereclause)] removevirtualtable[`vtablename] cloneuser[`user;`newuser;\"password\"] which are further explained in the script API. Permission control operates identically on the gateway. A user connected to the gateway must have access to the gateway, and their roles must have access to the .gw.syncexec or .gw.asyncexec functions. Usage Example To connect to a permissioned RDB in the TorQ system, a group and role for the user must be established. If the RDB contains the tables trade, quote, and depth, and the process contains the functions getdata[syms, bkttype,bktsize] and hloc[table], restricted access would be configured like so: .pm.adduser[`adam;`local;`md5;md5\"pass\"] .pm.adduser[`bob;`local;`md5;md5\"pass\"] .pm.addtogroup[`adam;`fulluser] .pm.addtogroup[`bob;`partuser] .pm.addtogroup[`fulluser;`partuser] .pm.grantaccess[`quote;`fulluser;`read] .pm.grantaccess[`trade;`partuser;`read] .pm.createvirtualtable[`quotenew;`quote;enlist(>;`time;(-;`.z.p;01:00))] .pm.grantaccess[`quotenew;`partuser;`read] .pm.assignrole[`adam;`toplevel] .pm.assignrole[`bob;`lowlevel] .pm.grantfunction[`getdata;`toplevel;{1b}] .pm.grantfunction[`getdata;`lowlevel;{x[`syms] in `GOOG}] .pm.grantfunction[`hloc;`toplevel;{1b}] .pm.grantfunction[`hloc;`lowlevel;{x[`table] in `trade}] This provides a system in which Bob can access only the trade table, while Adam has access to the trade table and quote table (through inheritance from Bob\u2019s group). Through a virtual table, if Bob runs \u201cselect from quotenew\u201d, he is able to get a table of the last hour of quotes. When the system is started in normal mode, there is no IPC access to the depth table, however if the system was started in permissive mode, in this case any user who could log in could access depth. Adam can run the getdata function however he wants, and Bob can only run it against sym GOOG. Similarly Adam can run hloc against any table, but Bob can only look at trade with it. Additionally, any system calls would need to be actively permissioned in the same way, after defining a systemuser role (or expanding the default role in TorQ). The superuser is given global function access by assigning them .pm.ALL in the function table, for example a tickerplant pushing to the RDB would need to have a user and role defined: .pm.adduser[`ticker;`local;`md5;md5\"plant\"] .pm.assignrole[`ticker;`tp] And then grant that role access to the .u.upd function: .pm.grantfunction[`.u.upd;`tp;{1b}] Although the .u.upd function updates to a table, there is no need to grant direct access to that table. Gateway Example The gateway user will have superuser role by default. The execution of a function passed through the gateway is checked against the user who sent the call. This should not be modified. Within the gateway itself, access to target processes can be controlled via the function table. For example, if Adam in the previous example was allowed to access only the RDB with .gw.syncexec, you could use: .pm.grantfunction[`.gw.syncexec;`toplevel;{x[`1] in `rdb}] Since .gw.syncexec is a projection, the arguments supplied are checked in order, with dictionary keys `0`1`2... etc. This could be further extended to restrict access to queries with the .pm.allowed[user;query] function, which checks permissions of the current user as listed on the gateway permission tables: .pm.grantfunction[`.gw.syncexec;`toplevel; {.pm.allowed[.z.u;x[`0]] and x[`1] in `rdb}] ldap.q Authentication with an ldap server is managed with ldap.q. It allows: A user to authenticate against an ldap server; Caching of user attempts to allow reauthentication without server if within checktime period; Users to be blocked if too many failed authentication attempts are made. Default parameters in the ldap namespace are set in {TORQHOME}/config/settings/default.q. parameter description enabled Whether ldap authentication is enabled debug Whether logging message are written to console server Host for ldap server. port Port number for ldap server. version Ldap version number. blocktime Time that must elapse before a blocked user can attempt to authenticate. If set to 0Np then the user is permanently blocked until an admin unblocks them. checklimit Login attempts before user is blocked. checktime Period of time that allows user to reauthenticate without confirming with ldap server. buildDNsuf Suffix for building distinguished name. buildDN Function to build distiniguished name. To get started the following will need altered from their default values: enabled, port, server, buildDNsuf. The value buildDNsuf is required to build a users bind_dn from the supplied username and is called by the function buildDN. An example definition is: .ldap.buildDNsuf:\"ou=users,dc=website,dc=com\"; Authentication is handled by .ldap.authenticate which is wrapped by .ldap.login, which is in turn wrapped by .z.pw when ldap authentication is enabled. When invoked .ldap.login retrieves the users latest authentication attempt from the cache, if it exists, and performs several checks before authenticating the user. To authenticate the function first checks whether the user has been blocked by reaching the checklimit and blocktime has not passed, immediately returning false if this is the case. If the user has previously successfully authenticated within the period defined by checktime and is using the same credentials authentication will be permitted. For all other cases an authentication attempt will be made against the ldap server. Example authentication attempt: .ldap.login[`user;pass] 0b To manually unblock a user the function .ldap.unblock must be passed their userame as a symbol. The function checks the cache to see whether a user is blocked and will reset the blocked status if necessary. An example usage of this function is: .ldap.unblock[`user] Diagnostic Reporting The message handler modifications provide a wealth of diagnostic information including: the timings and memory usage for every query run on a process; failed queries; clients trying to do things they are not permissioned for; the clients which are querying often and/or regularly extracting large datasets; the number of clients currently connected; timer calls and how long they take. Although not currently implemented, it would be straightforward to use this information to implement reports on the behaviour of each process and the overall health of the system. Similarly it would be straightforward to set up periodic publication to a central repository to have a single point for system diagnostic statistics.","title":"Handlers"},{"location":"handlers/#message-handlers","text":"There is a separate code directory containing message handler customizations. This is found at $KDBCODE/handlers. Much of the code is derived from Simon Garland\u2019s contributions to code.kx . Every external interaction with a process goes through a message handler, and these can be modified to, for example, log or restrict access. Passing through a bespoke function defined in a message handler will add extra processing time and therefore latency to the message. All the customizations we have provided aim to minimise additional latency, but if a bespoke process is latency sensitive then some or all of the customizations could be switched off. We would argue though that generally it is better to switch on all the message handler functions which provide diagnostic information, as for most non-latency sensitive processes (HDBs, Gateways, some RDBs etc.) the extra information upon failure is worth the cost. The message handlers can be globally switched off by setting .proc.loadhandlers to 0b in the configuration file.

The value buildDNsuf is required to build a users bind_dn from the supplied username and is called by the function buildDN. An example definition is: .ldap.buildDNsuf:\"ou=users,dc=website,dc=com\"; Authentication is handled by .ldap.authenticate which is wrapped by .ldap.login, which is in turn wrapped by .z.pw when ldap authentication is enabled. When invoked .ldap.login retrieves the users latest authentication attempt from the cache, if it exists, and performs several checks before authenticating the user. To authenticate the function first checks whether the user has been blocked by reaching the checklimit and blocktime has not passed, immediately returning false if this is the case.

It can be easily integrated with incumbent monitoring systems. We have outlined how to use two of our preferred options below- Monit and Datadog. Some of their features overlap and some are complementary. Monit Monit is a small open source utility for monitoring and managing UNIX systems. Monit's ease of use makes it the perfect tool for tracking the status of TorQ processes. Installation Monit is included in most Unix distributions but can also be downloaded from here . This monit addition to TorQ allows the monit config files to be easily generated, based on the contents of the process.csv file. The basic monit directory which has been added to TorQ can be seen below: ${TORQHOME} |---monit |---bin | |---monit.sh |---templates |---monitalert.cfg |---monitrc |---monittemplate.txt It is important to mention that AquaQ will not offer support for monitalert.cfg and monitrc . Those two files have been added as an example on how monit can be configured to monitor your system and to offer an out-of-the-box configuration that you can use to test that monit works. If the monit installation contains an updated version of monitrc, this should be used instead. Features Monit is only available for UNIX and it comes with a bash script that you can use to generate the configuration and start the processes. More details on how you use this script can be found below. We have also included a standard monitrc which will: Set the check interval to 30 seconds Set the location of the monit.log file Set the location of monit.state fsile Define the mail alert basic configuration Define the e-mail format Set the interface port (11000) user and password Set the location of the *.cfg files The monitalert.cfg it is only an example on how you can configure your own alerts for monitoring your UNIX system. There are no TorQ specific examples in this file. The only file which will be updated with future TorQ releases is the monittemplate.txt which generates the monitconfig.cfg . An example is included below: check process tickerplant1 matching \"15000 -proctype tickerplant -procname tickerplant1\" start program = \"/bin/bash -c '/home/USER/torqprodsupp/torqdev/deploy/torq.sh start tickerplant1'\" with timeout 10 seconds stop program = \"/bin/bash -c '/home/USER/torqprodsupp/torqdev/deploy/torq.sh stop tickerplant1'\" every \"* * * * *\" mode active Usage Guide If you want to use monit to monitor your UNIX system and TorQ processes you must first generate the configuration files and then start monit . We will assume that you start with a fresh copy of TorQ. Install TorQ and the any optional customisations (e.g. the TorQ Finanace Starter Pack) Navigate to ${TORQHOME}/monit/bin/ Execute: bash monit.sh generate all - to generate all the config files bash monit.sh generate alert - to generate the alert configuration file bash monit.sh generate monitconfig - to generate the monitconfig.cfg bash monit.sh generate monitrc - to generate the monitrc file However, you can also use your own configuration files by either creating a new directory in monit called config and moving all the .cfg files and the monitrc file in there or by modifying the last line in the monitrc to point to the folder where the .cfg files can be found. Start monit by executing bash monit.sh start The start function also take a parameter (\"string\") whch can specify the location of the monitrc . Datadog Datadog is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. This documentation provides a guideline on how to integrate TorQ and Datadog on a Linux host. Note: The Datadog Agent used in this integration is version 7, and may not be backwards or forwards compatible with other versions. See the Datadog documentation for more detail. Installation Please Note: At this time the integration of Datadog with TorQ is supported on a unix host. We have not yet provided instructions or functionality for the use of Datadog with TorQ on other operating systems. The Datadog Agent is software that runs on your host, collecting events and metrics from the host and sending them to Datadog, where you can analyze your monitoring and performance data. We have provided the functionality to monitor system metrics such as CPU and memory usage, report process errors to Datadog, perform data checks and visualise the results on a custom dashboard. The datadog agent can be installed here . Note that there are multiple price plans for Datadog, and the functionality available to you is dependent on your plan. A 14-day free trial is available, on which all the monitoring provided within this integration will work. Once you've set up an account with datadog, more information on getting started can be found here . An easy one-step install is provided as shown in the video above. Code is provided within TorQ to enable the integration of Datadog with a TorQ stack on a unix host. The directory layout of the relevant code is as shown below: ${TORQHOME} |---datadog |---Example_TorQ_Monitoring_Dashboard.json |---monitors |---setupdatadog.sh ${TORQHOME} |---code |---common | |---datadog.q |---monitor |---datadogchecks.q The setupdatadog.sh script is provided as a quick-start install to set up datadog on your host. It edits the config files required by datadog: Datadog.yaml, which contains the port number to listen on, and enables the agent to receive metrics and events from processes. Process.yaml, which determines which processes datadog will retrieve CPU and memory stats for. This file is generated using the process.csv, and by default all processes will be monitored. If you wish to monitor only certain processes, a \"datadog\" column can be added to the process.csv, and a value of 1 or 0 added to each of the processes (1 meaning monitored, 0 meaning not monitored). Features Send Metrics and Events Metrics are values sent from the system to quickly indicate the state of a process or the system itself. We have provided the functionality to send metrics from TorQ processes to the datadog agent, via the .dg.sendmetric function. q) .dg.sendmetric[\"metric_name\";metric_value] The default configuration generated by setupdatadog.sh also automates the sending of process stats as metrics, using the process.yaml as a template for which processes to monitor. Events are sent in a similar way to Metrics, but indicate a noteworthy record of activity We can send an event from a TorQ process using the .dg.sendevent function: .dg.sendevent[event_title;event_text;tags;alert_type] This expects string arguments, and can accept any number of custom tags, and an alert type one of \"error\", \"warning\" or \"success\". Send Process Errors To Datadog We can utilise the sendevent functionality to track any TorQ process errors on datadog. TorQ provides a hook for extended logging, .lg.ext. We have provided the option to edit this to send errors and warnings to datadog as events: enablelogging:{[] .lg.ext:{[olddef;loglevel;proctype;proc;id;message;dict] olddef[loglevel;proctype;proc;id;message;dict]; if[loglevel in `ERR`WARN;.dg.sendevent[string proc;message;string proctype;]$[loglevel=`ERR;\"error\";\"warning\"]]}[@[value;`.lg.ext;{{[loglevel;proctype;proc;id;message;dict]}}]] } By default, this is not enabled, but should you wish to enable this and view process errors and warnings, you can change the value of .dg.enabled in $TORQHOME/config/settings/default.q . .dg.enabled:1b Automate checks using monitor process TorQ's monitor process lets us define a series of user-specific checks to be run at specified intervals on specified processes. We have provided an example check ( .dg.isok ) and ( .dg.sendresultmetric ). The .dg.isok function is a simple check to see if a process is available and can be queried. The monitor process will execute this function within the processes it has been configured to monitor, and a value of 1b is returned if the process is available. Within the monitor process, the .dg.sendresultmetric result handler then sends this result to datadog as a metric, which can be displayed on the UI dashboard. Other checks can be added to provide more specific metrics to monitor, such as table record counts, e.g: .dg.checkcount:{[table;day] count select from table where date=day} No default monitor configuration is provided, but if you wish to add a check such as the above to be run by the monitor process, the monitorconfig.csv can be edited as shown: family|metric|process|query|resultchecker|params|period|runtime datadog|okcheck|rdb1;sort1;gateway1;hdb1;hdb2;wdb1;feed1|.dg.isok|.dg.sendresultmetric|`varname`cond!(`datadogcheck;`true)|0D00:01|0D00:00:00.5 Usage Guide If you wish to incorporate Datadog into your system as a monitoring tool, you can follow the instructions in the video above or the written instructions as follows. This will configure datadog according to default settings, and will not enable error logging or any monitoring functions unless configured by the user. Install Datadog agent on your host according to instructions here Set up required configuration on host: (Optional) Change the port on which the agent listens, DOGSTATSD_PORT. This can be edited in the setenv.sh script in the $TORQHOME directory, and will default to port 8125. Execute . setenv.sh in the $TORHOME directory, to pick up any changes to DOGSTATSD_PORT Execute . setupdatadog.sh . This will edit the required datadog config files, datadog.yaml and process.yaml. Restart the datadog agent: sudo service datadog-agent restart . This ensures the updated config is used by the agent. The agent is now reporting process stats, and these can be visualised on the datadog UI. For more detailed metrics and events, enable the error logging using .dg.enabled:1b and configure the monitor process to run some checks. Using the Datadog UI You can visualise your metrics and events on a dashboard, and configure monitors and alerts. An example dashboard has been provided in $TORQHOME/datadog/Example_TorQ_Monitoring_Dashboard.json. This displays simple metrics such as process cpu %, process memory % and relative changes in these, as well as TorQ-specific process checks and a stream of any errors from TorQ processes. To import this into your datadog UI, go to the dashboards section here And click add new screenboard . In the settings section, select import dashboard json and copy and paste the json or browse your files to select the json dashboard you want to import. You will be prompted with whether or not you want to replace whatever is on the screenboard - click yes. Your dashboard will then load and display as below. The appearance of the dashboard will depend on whether you've enabled the extended error logging, and configured the monitor process. Alternatively, you can create your own custom dashboard according to the documentation here Monitors can be set up to track metrics and establish alerts based on critical changes. We've provided some example monitors, designed to notify if a process goes down, or system resources reach a limit. To import an example monitor, go to the \"Monitors\" section on your datadog account, click New Monitor , then Import Monitor , and copy and paste the JSON of the monitor you'd like to use into the text box provided, then click save. The monitor will then become available and start alerting. You can create custom monitors using the guidelines in the Datadog documentation here Monitoring Multiple Hosts Depending on your datadog pricing plan, the option to monitor multiple hosts is provided. To integrate Datadog and TorQ across all hosts, you will need to install the agent on each host, and follow the installation instructions as above. If your TorQ setup is operating across different hosts, you will need to establish which processes to monitor on which host by configuring a \"datadog\" column in the process.csv as discussed earlier.","title":"Monitoring"},{"location":"monit/#monitoring-torq","text":"There are lots of standard tools available to monitor a TorQ stack.

There is also a function for returning the approximate memory usage of each variable in the process in descending order. Definitions are added using the .api.add function. A variable can be marked as public or private, and given a description, parameter list and return type. The search functions will return all the values found which match the pattern irrespective of them having a pre-defined definition. Whether a value is public or private is defined in the definitions table. If not found then by default all values are private, except those which live in the .q or top level namespace. .api.f is used to find a function, variable, table or view based on a case-insensitive pattern search.

We have provided an extension to allow multiple functions to be added to the timer and fired when required. The basic concept is that timer functions are registered in a table, with .z.ts periodically checking the table and running whichever functions are required. This is not a suitable mechanism where very high frequency timers are required (e.g. sub 500ms). There are two ways a function can be added to a timer- either as a repeating timer, or to fire at a specific time. When a repeating timer is specified, there are three options as to how the timer can be rescheduled. Assuming that a timer function with period P is scheduled to fire at time T0, actually fires at time T1 and finishes at time T2, then mode 0 will reschedule for T0+P; mode 1 will reschedule for T1+P; mode 2 will reschedule for T2+P. Both mode 0 and mode 1 have the potential for causing the timer to back up if the finish time T2 is after the next schedule time. See .api.p\u201c.timer.*\u201dfor more details. async.q kdb+ processes can communicate with each using either synchronous or asynchronous calls. Synchronous calls expect a response and so the server must process the request when it is received to generate the result and return it to the waiting client. Asynchronous calls do not expect a response so allow for greater flexibility. The effect of synchronous calls can be replicated with asynchronous calls in one of two ways (further details in section gateway): deferred synchronous: the client sends an async request, then blocks on the handle waiting for the result. This allows the server more flexibility as to how and when the query is processed; asynchronous postback: the client sends an async request which is wrapped in a function to be posted back to the client when the result is ready. This allows the server flexibility as to how and when the query is processed, and allows the client to continue processing while the server is generating the result. The code for both of these can get a little tricky, largely due to the amount of error trapping required. We have provided two functions to allow these methods to be used more easily. .async.deferred takes a list of handles and a query, and will return a two item list of (success;results). q).async.deferred[3 5;({system\"sleep 1\";system\"p\"};())] 1 1 9995 9996 q).async.deferred[3 5;({x+y};1;2)] 1 1 3 3 q).async.deferred[3 5;({x+y};1;`a)] 0 0 \"error: server fail:type\" \"error: server fail:type\" q).async.deferred[3 5 87;({system\"sleep 1\";system\"p\"};())] 1 1 0 9995i 9996i \"error: comm fail: failed to send query\" .async.postback takes a list of handles, a query, and the name or lambda of the postback function to return the result to. It will immediately return a success vector, and the results will be posted back to the client when ready. q).async.postback[3 5;({system\"sleep 1\";system\"p\"};());`showresult] 11b q) q)9995i 9996i q).async.postback[3 5;({x+y};1;2);`showresult] 11b q)3 3 q).async.postback[3 5;({x+y};1;`a);`showresult] 11b q)\"error: server fail:type\" \"error: server fail:type\" q).async.postback[3 5;({x+y};1;`a);showresult] 11b q)\"error: server fail:type\" \"error: server fail:type\" q).async.postback[3 5 87;({x+y};1;2);showresult] 110b q)3 3 For more details, see .api.p\u201c.async.*\u201d. cache.q cache.q provides a mechanism for storing function results in a cache and returning them from the cache if they are available and non stale. This can greatly boost performance for frequently run queries. The result set cache resides in memory and as such takes up space. It is up to the programmer to determine which functions are suitable for caching. Likely candidates are those where some or all of the following conditions hold: the function is run multiple times with the same parameters (perhaps different clients all want the same result set); the result set changes infrequently or the clients can accept slightly out-of-date values; the result set is not too large and/or is relatively expensive to produce. For example, it does not make sense to cache raw data extracts. The cache has a maximum size and a minimum size for any individual result set, both of which are defined in the configuration file. Size checks are done with -22! which will give an approximation (but underestimate) of the result set size. In the worst case the estimate could be half the size of the actual size. If a new result set is to be cached, the size is checked. Assuming it does not exceed the maximum individual size then it is placed in the cache. If the new cache size would exceed the maximum allowed space, other result sets are evicted from the cache. The current eviction policy is to remove the least recently accessed result sets until the required space is freed. The cache performance is tracked in a table. Cache adds, hits, fails, reruns and evictions are monitored. The main function to use the cache is .cache.execute[function; staletime]. If the function has been executed within the last staletime, then the result is returned from the cache. Otherwise the function is executed and placed in the cache. The function is run and the result placed in the cache: q)\\t r:.cache.execute[({system\"sleep 2\"; x+y};1;2);0D00:01] 2023 q)r 3 The second time round, the result set is returned immediately from the cache as we are within the staletime value: q)\\t r1:.cache.execute[({system\"sleep 2\"; x+y};1;2);0D00:01] 0 q)r1 3 If the time since the last execution is greater than the required stale time, the function is re-run, the cached result is updated, and the result returned: q)\\t r2:.cache.execute[({system\"sleep 2\"; x+y};1;2);0D00:00] 2008 q)r2 3 The cache performance is tracked: q).cache.getperf[] time id status function ------------------------------------------------------------------ 2013.11.06D12:41:53.103508000 2 add {system\"sleep 2\"; x+y} 1 2 2013.11.06D12:42:01.647731000 2 hit {system\"sleep 2\"; x+y} 1 2 2013.11.06D12:42:53.930404000 2 rerun {system\"sleep 2\"; x+y} 1 2 See .api.p.cache.*for more details. email.q A library file is provided to allow TorQ processes to send emails using an SMTP server. This is a wrapper around the standard libcurl library. The library file is currently available for Windows (32 bit), Linux (32 and 64 bit) and OSX (32 and 64 bit). The associated q script contains two main methods for creating a connection and sending emails. The email library requires a modification to the path to find the required libs - see the top of email.q for details. The main connection method .email.connect takes a single dictionary parameter and returns 0i for success and -1i for failure. Parameter Req Type Description url Y symbol URL of mail server e.g. smtp://mail.example.com user Y symbol Username of user to login as password Y symbol Password for user usessl N boolean Connect using SSL/TLS, defaults to false from N symbol Email from field, defaults to torq@aquaq.co.uk debug N integer Debug level. 0=no output, 1=normal output, 2=verbose output.

A connection must be established before an email can be sent. The send function returns an integer of the email length on success, or -1 on failure. Parameter Req Type Description to Y symbol (list) addresses to send to subject Y char list email subject body Y list of char lists email body cc N symbol (list) cc list bodyType N symbol type of email body. Can be `text or `html. Default is `text debug N integer Debug level. 0=no output, 1=normal output,2=verbose output.

In some circumstances it may be better to batch emails together to send, or to offload email sending to separate processes as communication with the SMTP server can take a little time. Two additional functions are available, .email.connectdefault and .email.senddefault. These are as above but will use the default configuration defined within the configuration files as the relevant parameters passed to the methods. In addition, .email.senddefault will automatically establish a connection. q).email.senddefault[`to`subject`body!(`$\"test@aquaq.co.uk\";\"test email\";(\"hi\";\"this is an email from torq\"))] 2015.01.02D12:43:34.646336000|aquaq||discovery1|INF|email|sending email 2015.01.02D12:43:35.743887000|aquaq||discovery1|INF|email|connection to mail server successful 2015.01.02D12:43:37.250427000|aquaq|discovery1|INF|email|email sent 16673i q).email.senddefault[`to`subject`body!(`$\"test@aquaq.co.uk\";\"test email 2\";(\"hi\";\"this is an email from torq\"))] 2015.01.02D12:43:48.115403000|aquaq|discovery1|INF|email|sending email 2015.01.02D12:43:49.385807000|aquaq|discovery1|INF|email|email sent 16675i q).email.senddefault[`to`subject`body!(`$\"test@aquaq.co.uk\";\"test email 2\";(\"hi\";\"this is an email from torq\");`\"$/home/ashortt/example.txt\")] 2015.01.02D12:43:48.115403000|aquaq|discovery1|INF|email|sending email 2015.01.02D12:43:49.385807000|aquaq|discovery1|INF|email|email sent 47338i .email.test will attempt to establish a connection to the default configured email server and send a test email to the specified address. debug should be set to 2i (verbose) to extract the full information. q).email.debug:2i q).email.test `$\"test@aquaq.co.uk\" ... A further function .email.sendviaservice can be used to send an email using the default mail server on a separate specified process and can be used to allow latency sensitive processes to offload this piece of functionality. The function takes two parameters a process and a dictionary which should follow the same format as .email.send. The function uses the .async.postback Utility to send the email by calling .email.servicesend on the specified process. The postback function immediately returns a success boolean indicating that the the async request has been sent and when the function has been run on the server the results are posted back to the client function email.servicecallback which logs the email status. q).email.sendviaservice[`emailservice;`to`subject`body!(`$\"test@aquaq.co.uk\";\"test email\";(\"hi\";\"this is an email from torq\"))] 1b q)2019.01.04D12:02:57.641940000|gateway|gateway1|INF|email|Email sent successfully Additionally functions are available within the email library.

Emails with SSL certificates from Windows If you wish to send emails via an account which requires authentication from Windows (e.g. Hotmail, Gmail) then you have to do a few extra steps as usessl must be true and Windows does not usually find the correct certificate. The steps are: download this and save it to your PC set CURLOPT_CAINFO=c:/path/to/cabundle_file/ca-bundle.crt More information is available here and here timezone.q A slightly customised version of the timezone conversion functionality from code.kx. It loads a table of timezone information from $KDBCONFIG. See .api.p.tz.*for more details. compress.q compress.q applies compression to any kdb+ database, handles all partition types including date, month, year, int, and can deal with top level splayed tables. It will also decompress files as required. Once the compression/decompression is complete, summary statistics are returned, with detailed statistics for each compressed or decompressed file held in a table. The utility is driven by the configuration specified within a csv file. Default parameters can be given, and these can be used to compress all files within the database. However, the compress.q utility also provides the flexibility to compress different tables with different compression parameters, and different columns within tables using different parameters. A function is provided which will return a table showing each file in the database to be compressed, and how, before the compression is performed. Compression is performed using the -19! operator, which takes 3 parameters; the compression algorithm to use (0 - none, 1 - kdb+ IPC, 2 - gzip), the compression blocksize as a power of 2 (between 12 and 19), and the level of compression to apply (from 0 - 9, applicable only for gzip). (For further information on -19! and the parameters used, see code.kx.com.) The compressionconfig.csv file should have the following format: table,minage,column,calgo,cblocksize,clevel default,20,default,2,17,6 trades,20,default,1,17,0 quotes,20,asize,2,17,7 quotes,20,bsize,2,17,7 This file can be placed in the config folder, or a path to the file given at run time. The compression utility compresses all tables and columns present in the HDB but not specified in the driver file according the default parameters. In effect, to compress an entire HDB using the same compression parameters, a single row with name default would suffice. To specify that a particular table should be compressed in a certain different manner, it should be listed in the table. If default is given as the column for this table, then all of the columns of that table will be compressed accordingly. To specify the compression parameters for particular columns, these should be listed individually. For example, the file above will compress trades tables 20 days old or more with an algorithm of 1, and a blocksize of 17. The asize and bsize columns of any quotes tables older than 20 days old will be compressed using algorithm 2, blocksize 17 and level 7. All other files present will be compressed according to the default, using an algorithm 2, blocksize 17 and compression level 6. To leave files uncompressed, you must specify them explicitly in the table with a calgo of 0. If the file is already compressed, note that an algorithm of 0 will decompress the file. This utility should be used with caution. Before running the compression it is recommended to run the function .cmp.showcomp, which takes three parameters - the path to the database, the path to the csv file, and the maximum age of the files to be compressed: .cmp.showcomp[`:/full/path/to/HDB;.cmp.inputcsv;maxage] /- for using the csv file in the config folder .cmp.showcomp[`:/full/path/to/HDB;`:/full/path/to/csvfile;maxage] /- to specify a file This function produces a table of the files to be compressed, the parameters with which they will be compressed, and the current size of the file. Note that the current size column is calculated using hcount; on a file which is already compressed this returns the uncompressed length, i.e. this cannot be used as a signal as to whether the file is compressed already. fullpath column table partition age calgo cblocksize clevel compressage currentsize ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- :/home/hdb/2013.11.05/depth/asize1 asize1 depth 2013.11.05 146 0 17 8 1 787960 :/home/hdb/2013.11.05/depth/asize2 asize2 depth 2013.11.05 146 0 17 8 1 787960 :/home/hdb/2013.11.05/depth/asize3 asize3 depth 2013.11.05 146 0 17 8 1 787960 :/home/hdb/2013.11.05/depth/ask1 ask1 depth 2013.11.05 146 0 17 8 1 1575904 .... To then run the compression function, use .cmp.compressmaxage with the same parameters as .cmp.showcomp (hdb path, csv path, maximum age of files): .cmp.compressmaxage[`:/full/path/to/HDB;.cmp.inputcsv;maxage] /- for using the csv file in the config folder .cmp.compressmaxage[`:/full/path/to/HDB;`:/full/path/to/csvfile;maxage] /- to specify a file To run compression on all files in the database disregarding the maximum age of the files (i.e. from minage as specified in the configuration file to infinitely old), then use: .cmp.docompression[`:/full/path/to/HDB;.cmp.inputcsv] /- for using the csv file in the config folder .cmp.docompression[`:/full/path/to/HDB;`:/full/path/to/csvfile] /- to specify a file Logs are produced for each file which is compressed or decompressed. Once the utility is complete, the statistics of the compression are also logged. This includes the memory savings in MB from compression, the additional memory usage in MB for decompression, the total compression ratio, and the total decompression ratio: |comp1|INF|compression|Memory savings from compression: 34.48MB. Total compression ratio: 2.51. |comp1|INF|compression|Additional memory used from de-compression: 0.00MB.

A note for windows users - windows supports compression only with a compression blocksize of 16 or more. dataloader.q This script contains some utility functions to assist in loading data from delimited files (e.g. comma separated, tab delimited). It is a more generic version of the data loader example on code.kx . The supplied functions allow data to be read in configurable size chunks and written out to the database. When all the data is written, the on-disk data is re-sorted and the attributes are applied. The main function is .loader.loadalldata which takes two parameters- a dictionary of loading parameters and a directory containing the files to read. The dictionary should/can have the following fields: Parameter Req Type Description headers Y symbol list Names of the header columns in the file types Y char list Data types to read from the file separator Y char[list] Delimiting character. Enlist it if first line of file is header data tablename Y symbol Name of table to write data to dbdir Y symbol Directory to write data to symdir N symbol Directory to enumerate against partitiontype N symbol Partitioning to use. Must be one of `date`month`year`int. Default is `date partitioncol N symbol Column to use to extract partition information.Default is `time dataprocessfunc N function Diadic function to process data after it has been read in. First argument is load parameters dictionary, second argument is data which has been read in. Default is {[x;y] y} chunksize N int Data size in bytes to read in one chunk. Default is 100 MB compression N int list Compression parameters to use e.g. 17 2 6. Default is empty list for no compression gc N boolean Whether to run garbage collection at appropriate points. Default is 0b (false) filepattern N char[list] Pattern used to only load certain files e.g. \" .csv\",(\" .csv\",\"*.txt\") Example usage: .loader.loadallfiles[`headers`types`separator`tablename`dbdir!(`sym`time`price`volume;\"SP FI\";\",\";`trade;`:hdb); `:TDC/toload] .loader.loadallfiles[`headers`types`separator`tablename`dbdir`dataprocessfunc`chunksize`partitiontype`partitioncol`compression`gc`filepattern!(`sym`time`price`volume;\"SP FI\";enlist\",\";`tradesummary;`:hdb;{[p;t] select sum size, max price by date:time.date from t};`int$500*2 xexp 20;`month;`date;16 1 0;1b;(\"*.csv\";\"*.txt\")); `:TDC/toload] subscriptions.q The subscription utilities allow multiple subscriptions to different data sources to be managed and maintained. Automatic resubscriptions in the event of failure are possible, along as specifying whether the process will get the schema and replay the log file from the remote source (e.g. in the case of tickerplant subscriptions). .sub.getsubscriptionhandles is used to get a table of processes to subscribe to. It takes a process type and process name, where () or a null symbol can be used for all: .sub.getsubscriptionhandles[`tickerplant;();()!()] / all processes of type tickerplant .sub.getsubscriptionhandles[`;`rdb1;()!()] / all processes called 'rdb1' .sub.getsubscriptionhandles[`;`;()!()] / all processes .sub.getsubscriptionhandles[();();()!()] / nothing .sub.subscribe is used to subscribe to a process for the supplied list of tables and instruments. For example, to subscribe to instruments A, B and C for the quote table from all tickerplants: .sub.subscribe[`trthquote;`A`B;0b;0b] each .sub.getsubscriptionhandles[`tickerplant;();()!()] The subscription method uses backtick for \u201call\u201d (which is the same as kdb+tick). To subscribe to all tables, all instruments, from all tickerplants: .sub.subscribe[`;`;0b;0b] each .sub.getsubscriptionhandles[`tickerplant;();()!()] See .api.p\u201c.sub.*\u201d for more details. pubsub.q pubsub.q is essentially a placeholder script to allow publish and subscribe functionality to be implemented. Licenced kdb+tick users can use the publish and subscribe functionality implemented in u.[k|q]. If u.[k|q] is placed in the common code directory and loaded before pubsub.q (make sure u.[k|q] is listed before pubsub.q in order.txt) then publish and subscribe will be implemented. You can also build out this file to add your own publish and subscribe routines as required. kafka.q kafka.q provides q language bindings for Apache Kafka, a 'distributed streaming platform', a real time messaging system with persistent storage in message logs. The core functionality of Kafka \u2013 pub/sub messaging with persisted logs, will be familiar to most readers as the functionality offered by the kdb+ tick tickerplant. The tickerplant log allows the real time database and other consumers to replay a day\u2019s events to recover state. An application architecture built around Kafka could dispense with a tickerplant component, and have RDBs and other real time clients query Kafka on startup for offsets, and play back the data they need. While not suitable for very low latency access to streaming data, it would carry some advantages for very high throughput applications, particularly those in the cloud: Kafka\u2019s distributed nature should allow it to scale more transparently than splitting tickerplants by instrument universe or message type Replaying from offsets is the same interface as live pub/sub and doesn\u2019t require filesystem access to the tickerplant log, so RDB\u2019s and other consumer could be on a different server By default, the Kafka bindings will be loaded into all TorQ processes running on l64 systems (the only platform currently supported). An example of usage is shown here (this assumes a local running instance of kafka - instructions for this are available on the kafkaq github repo): q).kafka.initconsumer[`localhost:9092;()] q).kafka.initproducer[`localhost:9092;()] q)kupd / print default definition for incoming data - ignore key, print message as ascii {[k;x] -1 `char$x;} q).kafka.subscribe[`test;0] / subscribe to topic test, partition 0 q)pub:{.kafka.publish[`test;0;`;`byte$x]} / define pub to publish text input to topic test on partition 0 with no key defined q)pub\"hello world\" q)hello world Limitations of the current implementation: Only l64 supported Single consumer thread subscribed to one topic at a time tplogutils.q tplogutils.q contains functions for recovering tickerplant log files. Under certain circumstances the tickerplant log file can become corrupt by having an invalid sequence of bytes written to it. A log file can be recovered using a simple recovery method. However, this will only recover messages up to the first invalid message. The recovery functions defined in tplogutils.q allow all valid messages to be recovered from the tickerplant log file. monitoringchecks.q monitoringchecks.q implements a set of standard, basic monitoring checks. They include checks to ensure: table sizes are increasing during live capture the HDB data saves down correctly the allocated memory of a process does not increase past a certain size the size of the symbol list in memory doesn\u2019t grow to big the process does not have too much on its pending subscriber queue These checks are intended to be run by the reporter process on a schedule, and any alerts emailed to an appropriate recipient list. heartbeat.q heartbeat.q implements heartbeating, and relies on both timer.q and pubsub.q. A table called heartbeat will be published periodically, allowing downstream processes to detect the availability of upstream components. The heartbeat table contains a heartbeat time and counter. The heartbeat script contains functions to handle and process heartbeats and manage upstream process failures. See .api.p.hb.*for details. rmvr.q This file contains a function which can be used to convert environment variable paths into a full path from the root directory. os.q A file with various q functions to perform system operations. This will detect your operating system and will perform the correct commands depending on what you are using. This is a modification of a script developed by Simon Garland. dbwriteutils.q This contains a set of utility functions for writing data to historic databases. Sorting and Attributes The sort utilities allow the sort order and attributes of tables to be globally defined. This helps to manage the code base when the data can potentially be written from multiple locations (e.g. written from the RDB, loaded from flat file, replayed from the tickerplant log). The configuration is defined in a csv which defaults to $KDBCONFG/sort.csv. The default setup is that every table is sorted by sym and time, with a p attribute on sym (this is the standard kdb+ tick configuration). aquaq$ tail config/sort.csv tabname,att,column,sort default,p,sym,1 default,,time,1 As an example, assume we have an optiontrade table which we want to be different from the standard set up. We would like the table to be sorted by optionticker and then time, with a p attribute on optionticker. We also have a column called underlyingticker which we can put an attribute on as it is derived from optionticker (so there is an element of de-normalisation present in the table). We also have an exchange field which we would like to put a g attribute on. All other tables we want to be sorted and parted in the standard way. The configuration file would look like this (sort order is derived from the order within the file combined with the sort flag being set to true): aquaq$ tail config/sort.csv tabname,att,column,sort default,p,sym,1 default,,time,1 optiontrade,p,optionticker,1 optiontrade,,exchtime,1 optiontrade,p,underlyingticker,0 optiontrade,g,exchange,0 To invoke the sort utilities, supply a list of (tablename; partitions) e.g. q).sort.sorttab(`trthtrade;`:hdb/2014.11.20/trthtrade`:hdb/2014.11.20/trthtrade) 2014.12.03D09:56:19.214006000|aquaq|test|INF|sort|sorting the trthtrade table 2014.12.03D09:56:19.214045000|aquaq|test|INF|sorttab|No sort parameters have been specified for : trthtrade.

This is useful when data can be written from mutliple different processes e.g. RDB, WDB, or tickerplant log replay. Instead of having to create a separate definition of customised manipulation in each process, it can be done in a single location and invokved in each process. help.q The standard help.q from code.kx provides help utilities in the console. This should be kept up to date with [ code.kx ]. q)help` adverb | adverbs/operators attributes| data attributes cmdline | command line parameters data | data types define | assign, define, control and debug dotz | .z locale contents errors | error messages save | save/load tables syscmd | system commands temporal | temporal - date & time casts verbs | verbs/functions html.q An HTML utility has been added to accompany the HTML5 front end for the Monitoring process. It includes functions to format dates, tables to csv to configure the HTML file to work on the correct process. It is accessible from the .html namespace. eodtime.q This script provides functionality for managing timezones. TorQ can be configured to timestamp data in a specific timezone, while also being configured to perform the end of day rollover in another timezone, at a configurable time. These options are handled by three settings: Setting Req Type Description .eodtime.rolltimeoffset Y timespan Offset from default midnight roll time .eodtime.rolltimezone Y symbol Time zone in which to rollover .eodtime.datatimezone Y symbol Time zone in which to timestamp data in TP The default configuration sets both timezones to GMT and has the rollover performed at midnight. A table containing the valid timezones is loaded into TorQ processes as .tz.t An example configuration where data is stamped in GMT, but the rollover occurs at 5PM New York time would be: .eodtime.rolltimeoffset:-0D07:00:00.000000000; // 5 PM i.e. 7 hours before midnight .eodtime.rolltimezone:`$\"America/New_YorK\"; // roll in NYC time .eodtime.datatimezone:`$\"GMT\"; // timestamp in GMT Note that the rolltimeoffset can be negative - this will cause the rollover to happen \"yesterday\", meaning that at the rolltime, the trading date will become the day after the calendar date. Where this is positive, the rollover occurs \"today\" and so the trading date will become the current calendar date. subscribercutoff.q This script is used to provide functionality for cutting off any slow subscribers on any TorQ processes. The script will periodically check (time between checks set in .subcut.checkfreq. Default is 1 minute) the byte size of the queue for all the handles on the process to see if they have exceeded a set cut-off point (set in the variable .subcut.maxsize) and will only cut-off the handle if it exceeds this limit a set number of times in a row (default is 3 and set in the .subcut.breachlimit variable). This gives clients a chance to tidy up their behavior and will avoid cutting off clients if they happened to have a spike just before the check was performed. The .subcut.state variable is used to keep track of the handles and the number of times they have exceeded the size limit in a row. To enable this functionality the .subcut.enabled flag must be set to true and the timer.q script must be loaded on the desired processes. By default the chained tickerplant is the only processes with the functionality enabled. datareplay.q The datareplay utility provides functionality for generating tickerplant function calls from historcial data which can be executed by subscriber functions. This can be used to test a known data-set against a subscriber for testing or debugging purposes. It can load this data from the current TorQ session, or from a remote hdb if given its connection handle. It can also chunk the data by time increments (as if the tickerplant was in batch mode), and can also generate calls to a custom timer function for the same time increments (defaults to .z.ts). The functions provided by this utility are made available in the .datareplay namespace. The utility is mainly used via the tabesToDataStreamFunction, which accepts a dictionary parameter with the following fields: Key Example Value Description Required Default tabs `trade`quote or `trade List of tables to include Yes N/A sts 2014.04.04D07:00:00.000 Start timestamp for data Yes N/A ets 2014.04.04D16:30:00.000 End of timestamp for data Yes N/A syms `AAPL`IBM List of symbols to include No All syms where ,(=;`src;,`L) Custom where clause in functional form No none timer 1b Generate timer function flag No 0b h 5i Handle to hdb process No 0i (self) interval 0D00:00:01.00 Time interval used to chunk data, bucketed by timestamp if no time interval set No None tc `data_time Name of time column to cut on No `time timerfunc .z.ts Timer function to use if `timer parameter is set No .z.ts When the timer flag is set, the utility will interleave timer function calls in the message column at intervals based on the interval parameter, or every 10 seconds if interval is not set. This is useful if testing requires a call to a function at a set time, to generate a VWAP every 10 minutes for example. The function the timer messages call is based on the timerfunc parameter, or .z.ts if this parameter is not set. If the interval is set the messages will be aggregated into chunks based on the interval value, if no interval is specified, the data will be bucketed by timestamp (one message chunk per distinct timestamp per table). If no connection handle is specified (h parameter), the utility will retrieve the data from the process the utility is running on, using handle 0. The where parameter allows for the use of a custom where clause when extracting data, which can be useful when the dataset is large and only certain data is required, for example if only data where src=`L is required. The where clause(s) are required to be in functional form, for example enlist (=;`src;,`L) or ((=;`src;enlist `L);(>;`size;100)) (note, that if only one custom where clause is included it is required to be enlisted). It is possible to get the functional form of a where clause by running parse on a mock select string like below: q)parse \"select from t where src=`L,size>100\" ? `t ,((=;`src;,`L);(>;`size;100)) 0b () The where clause is then the 3rd item returned in the parse tree. Examples: Extract all data between sts and ets from the trades table in the current process. q)input tabs| `trades sts | 2014.04.21D07:00:00.000000000 ets | 2014.05.02D17:00:00.000000000 q).datareplay.tablesToDataStream input time msg .. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------.. 2014.04.21D08:00:23.478000000 `upd `trades `sym`time`src`price`size!(`YHOO;20.. 2014.04.21D08:00:49.511000000 `upd `trades `sym`time`src`price`size!(`YHOO;20.. 2014.04.21D08:01:45.623000000 `upd `trades `sym`time`src`price`size!(`YHOO;20.. 2014.04.21D08:02:41.346000000 `upd `trades `sym`time`src`price`size!(`YHOO;20.. .. q)first .datareplay.tablesToDataStream input time| 2014.04.21D08:00:23.478000000 msg | (`upd;`trades;`sym`time`src`price`size!(`YHOO;2014.04.21D08:00:23.47800..

Modified u.q Starting in kdb+ v3.4, the new broadcast feature has some performance benefits. It works by serialising a message once before sending it asynchronously to a list of subscribers whereas the previous method would serialise it separately for each subscriber.

Currently it supports a variety of data sources including Graphite, InfluxDb & Prometheus with users including the likes of Paypal, Ebay, Intel and Booking.com. However, there is no in-built support for direct analysis of data from kdb+. Thus, using the SimpleJSON data source , we have engineered an adaptor to allow visualisation of kdb+ data. Requirements Grafana v5.2.2+ (Tested on Kdb v3.5+) Getting Started Download and set up Grafana. This is well explained on the Grafana website , where you have the option to either download the software locally or let Grafana host it for you. For the purpose of this document, we host the software locally. Pull down this repository with the adaptor already installed in code/common. In your newly installed Grafana folder (eg.grafana-5.2.2/) run the command: ./bin/grafana-server web . This will start your Grafana server. If you would like to alter the port which this is run on, this can be changed in: /grafana-5.2.2/conf/custom.ini , Where custom.ini should be a copy of defaults.ini. You can now open the Grafana server in your web browser where you will be greeted with a login page to fill in appropriately. Once logged in, navigate to the configurations->plugin section where you will find the simple JSON adaptor, install this. Upon installation of the JSON you can now set-up your datasource. Host your data on a port accesible to Grafana, eg. the RDB. In the \"add new datasource\" panel, enter the details for the port in which your data is hosted, making the type SimpleJSON. Run the test button on the bottom of your page, this should succeed and you are ready to go! Using the adaptor As the adaptor is part of the TorQ framework it will automatically be loaded into TorQ sessions. From this point onwards you can proceed to use Grafana as it is intended, with the only difference coming in the form of the queries. Use cases and further examples of the queries can be seen in our blogpost: The Grafana-KDB Adaptor . For information and examples of how to execute server side functions in queries, please read our followup blogpost on the subject: Grafana kdb+ Adaptor Update . Here you can see examples of graphs, tables, heatmaps and single statistics. The best explanation of the inputs allowed in the query section can be seen pictorially here: Upon opening the query box, in the metrics tab, the user will be provided with a populated drop down of all possible options. Server functions are not included in the dropdown, but can be called by entering the letter f followed by the value of .grafana.del (see below) before their function call. Due to the limitations of the JSON messages, it is not possible for our adaptor to distinguish between panels. Consequently, every possible option is returned for each panel, the user can reduce these choices by simply entering the first letter of their panel type, g for graph, t for table and o for other (heatmap or single stat). From here, you can follow the above diagram to specify your type of query. Limitations & Assumptions This adaptor has been built to allow visualisation of real-time and historical data. It is capable of handling static and timeseries data. In addition, the drop-down options have been formed such that only one query is possible per panel. If more than one query on a specfic panel is made it will throw an error. To get around this, we added the options of including all \"syms\" in queries so the options can be filtered out in the legend. Table queries should work for any table format supplied to the adaptor. However, time series data is limited by the requriment of a time column, in our adaptor we assume this column to be called time. This assumption can be modified to fit your data in the settings (config/settings/defualt.q) file which dictates the following lines at the start of the script: // user defined column name of time column timecol:@[value;`.grafana.timecol;`time]; // user defined column name of sym column sym:@[value;`.grafana.sym;`sym]; // user defined date range to find syms from timebackdate:@[value;`.grafana.timebackdate;2D]; // user defined number of ticks to return ticks:@[value;`.grafana.ticks;1000]; // user defined query argument deliminator del:@[value;`.grafana.del;\".\"]; .grafana.timecol represents the name of the time column and thus can be reassigned if your time column has a different name, eg. date. One more common modification could be changing the variable .grafana.sym which defines the name of the the sym column, which is normally referenced in financial data. However if the data is non-financial this could be tailored to represent another identifier such as name or postcode. This column is used to populate the drop down options in the query selector. .grafana.timebackdate is a user definable variable which dictates how far back into a hdb the adaptor will look to gather options for distinct syms to populate the dropdowns. It is important to note that this should be increased if all your required syms are not in the last 2 days. Optionally a user could hard code this list or implement their own search function to limit interrogation of the database. .grafana.ticks can be defined so that only n rows from the end of the table will be queried. This can be left as large as the user likes, but is included for managing large partitioned tables. One final important variable is .grafana.del , this dictates the delimeter between options in the drop down menus. This has significant repercussions if one of your columns includes full stops, eg. email adresses. As a result we have left this as definable so that the user can alter this to a non-disruptive value for their data eg./.","title":"Utilities"},{"location":"utilities/#utilities","text":"We have provided several utility scripts, which either implement developer aids or standard operations which are useful across processes.","title":"Utilities"},{"location":"utilities/#apiq","text":"This provides a mechanism for documenting and publishing function/variable/table or view definitions within the kdb+ process.

We have provided an extension to allow multiple functions to be added to the timer and fired when required. The basic concept is that timer functions are registered in a table, with .z.ts periodically checking the table and running whichever functions are required. This is not a suitable mechanism where very high frequency timers are required (e.g. sub 500ms). There are two ways a function can be added to a timer- either as a repeating timer, or to fire at a specific time. When a repeating timer is specified, there are three options as to how the timer can be rescheduled. Assuming that a timer function with period P is scheduled to fire at time T0, actually fires at time T1 and finishes at time T2, then mode 0 will reschedule for T0+P; mode 1 will reschedule for T1+P; mode 2 will reschedule for T2+P.

Synchronous calls expect a response and so the server must process the request when it is received to generate the result and return it to the waiting client. Asynchronous calls do not expect a response so allow for greater flexibility. The effect of synchronous calls can be replicated with asynchronous calls in one of two ways (further details in section gateway): deferred synchronous: the client sends an async request, then blocks on the handle waiting for the result. This allows the server more flexibility as to how and when the query is processed; asynchronous postback: the client sends an async request which is wrapped in a function to be posted back to the client when the result is ready. This allows the server flexibility as to how and when the query is processed, and allows the client to continue processing while the server is generating the result. The code for both of these can get a little tricky, largely due to the amount of error trapping required. We have provided two functions to allow these methods to be used more easily. .async.deferred takes a list of handles and a query, and will return a two item list of (success;results). q).async.deferred[3 5;({system\"sleep 1\";system\"p\"};())] 1 1 9995 9996 q).async.deferred[3 5;({x+y};1;2)] 1 1 3 3 q).async.deferred[3 5;({x+y};1;`a)] 0 0 \"error: server fail:type\" \"error: server fail:type\" q).async.deferred[3 5 87;({system\"sleep 1\";system\"p\"};())] 1 1 0 9995i 9996i \"error: comm fail: failed to send query\" .async.postback takes a list of handles, a query, and the name or lambda of the postback function to return the result to.

This can greatly boost performance for frequently run queries. The result set cache resides in memory and as such takes up space. It is up to the programmer to determine which functions are suitable for caching. Likely candidates are those where some or all of the following conditions hold: the function is run multiple times with the same parameters (perhaps different clients all want the same result set); the result set changes infrequently or the clients can accept slightly out-of-date values; the result set is not too large and/or is relatively expensive to produce. For example, it does not make sense to cache raw data extracts. The cache has a maximum size and a minimum size for any individual result set, both of which are defined in the configuration file. Size checks are done with -22! which will give an approximation (but underestimate) of the result set size. In the worst case the estimate could be half the size of the actual size. If a new result set is to be cached, the size is checked. Assuming it does not exceed the maximum individual size then it is placed in the cache. If the new cache size would exceed the maximum allowed space, other result sets are evicted from the cache. The current eviction policy is to remove the least recently accessed result sets until the required space is freed. The cache performance is tracked in a table. Cache adds, hits, fails, reruns and evictions are monitored. The main function to use the cache is .cache.execute[function; staletime]. If the function has been executed within the last staletime, then the result is returned from the cache. Otherwise the function is executed and placed in the cache.

It will also decompress files as required. Once the compression/decompression is complete, summary statistics are returned, with detailed statistics for each compressed or decompressed file held in a table. The utility is driven by the configuration specified within a csv file. Default parameters can be given, and these can be used to compress all files within the database. However, the compress.q utility also provides the flexibility to compress different tables with different compression parameters, and different columns within tables using different parameters. A function is provided which will return a table showing each file in the database to be compressed, and how, before the compression is performed. Compression is performed using the -19! operator, which takes 3 parameters; the compression algorithm to use (0 - none, 1 - kdb+ IPC, 2 - gzip), the compression blocksize as a power of 2 (between 12 and 19), and the level of compression to apply (from 0 - 9, applicable only for gzip). (For further information on -19! and the parameters used, see code.kx.com.)

The compression utility compresses all tables and columns present in the HDB but not specified in the driver file according the default parameters. In effect, to compress an entire HDB using the same compression parameters, a single row with name default would suffice. To specify that a particular table should be compressed in a certain different manner, it should be listed in the table. If default is given as the column for this table, then all of the columns of that table will be compressed accordingly. To specify the compression parameters for particular columns, these should be listed individually. For example, the file above will compress trades tables 20 days old or more with an algorithm of 1, and a blocksize of 17. The asize and bsize columns of any quotes tables older than 20 days old will be compressed using algorithm 2, blocksize 17 and level 7. All other files present will be compressed according to the default, using an algorithm 2, blocksize 17 and compression level 6. To leave files uncompressed, you must specify them explicitly in the table with a calgo of 0. If the file is already compressed, note that an algorithm of 0 will decompress the file. This utility should be used with caution. Before running the compression it is recommended to run the function .cmp.showcomp, which takes three parameters - the path to the database, the path to the csv file, and the maximum age of the files to be compressed: .cmp.showcomp[`:/full/path/to/HDB;.cmp.inputcsv;maxage] /- for using the csv file in the config folder .cmp.showcomp[`:/full/path/to/HDB;`:/full/path/to/csvfile;maxage] /- to specify a file This function produces a table of the files to be compressed, the parameters with which they will be compressed, and the current size of the file.

This is well explained on the Grafana website , where you have the option to either download the software locally or let Grafana host it for you. For the purpose of this document, we host the software locally. Pull down this repository with the adaptor already installed in code/common. In your newly installed Grafana folder (eg.grafana-5.2.2/) run the command: ./bin/grafana-server web . This will start your Grafana server. If you would like to alter the port which this is run on, this can be changed in: /grafana-5.2.2/conf/custom.ini , Where custom.ini should be a copy of defaults.ini. You can now open the Grafana server in your web browser where you will be greeted with a login page to fill in appropriately. Once logged in, navigate to the configurations->plugin section where you will find the simple JSON adaptor, install this. Upon installation of the JSON you can now set-up your datasource. Host your data on a port accesible to Grafana, eg. the RDB. In the \"add new datasource\" panel, enter the details for the port in which your data is hosted, making the type SimpleJSON.

From this point onwards you can proceed to use Grafana as it is intended, with the only difference coming in the form of the queries. Use cases and further examples of the queries can be seen in our blogpost: The Grafana-KDB Adaptor . For information and examples of how to execute server side functions in queries, please read our followup blogpost on the subject: Grafana kdb+ Adaptor Update . Here you can see examples of graphs, tables, heatmaps and single statistics. The best explanation of the inputs allowed in the query section can be seen pictorially here: Upon opening the query box, in the metrics tab, the user will be provided with a populated drop down of all possible options. Server functions are not included in the dropdown, but can be called by entering the letter f followed by the value of .grafana.del (see below) before their function call. Due to the limitations of the JSON messages, it is not possible for our adaptor to distinguish between panels. Consequently, every possible option is returned for each panel, the user can reduce these choices by simply entering the first letter of their panel type, g for graph, t for table and o for other (heatmap or single stat). From here, you can follow the above diagram to specify your type of query.","title":"Using the adaptor"},{"location":"utilities/#limitations-assumptions","text":"This adaptor has been built to allow visualisation of real-time and historical data. It is capable of handling static and timeseries data. In addition, the drop-down options have been formed such that only one query is possible per panel. If more than one query on a specfic panel is made it will throw an error. To get around this, we added the options of including all \"syms\" in queries so the options can be filtered out in the legend. Table queries should work for any table format supplied to the adaptor. However, time series data is limited by the requriment of a time column, in our adaptor we assume this column to be called time. This assumption can be modified to fit your data in the settings (config/settings/defualt.q) file which dictates the following lines at the start of the script: // user defined column name of time column timecol:@[value;`.grafana.timecol;`time]; // user defined column name of sym column sym:@[value;`.grafana.sym;`sym]; // user defined date range to find syms from timebackdate:@[value;`.grafana.timebackdate;2D]; // user defined number of ticks to return ticks:@[value;`.grafana.ticks;1000]; // user defined query argument deliminator del:@[value;`.grafana.del;\".\"]; .grafana.timecol represents the name of the time column and thus can be reassigned if your time column has a different name, eg. date. One more common modification could be changing the variable .grafana.sym which defines the name of the the sym column, which is normally referenced in financial data. However if the data is non-financial this could be tailored to represent another identifier such as name or postcode. This column is used to populate the drop down options in the query selector. .grafana.timebackdate is a user definable variable which dictates how far back into a hdb the adaptor will look to gather options for distinct syms to populate the dropdowns. It is important to note that this should be increased if all your required syms are not in the last 2 days. Optionally a user could hard code this list or implement their own search function to limit interrogation of the database. .grafana.ticks can be defined so that only n rows from the end of the table will be queried. This can be left as large as the user likes, but is included for managing large partitioned tables. One final important variable is .grafana.del , this dictates the delimeter between options in the drop down menus. This has significant repercussions if one of your columns includes full stops, eg. email adresses. As a result we have left this as definable so that the user can alter this to a non-disruptive value for their data eg./.","title":"Limitations &amp; Assumptions"},{"location":"visualisation/","text":"Visualisation kdb+ supports websockets and so HTML5 GUIs can be built. We have incorporated a set of server side and client side utilities to ease HTML GUI development. kdb+ Utilities The server side utilities are contained in html.q. These utilise some community code, specifically json.k and a modified version of u.q, both from Kx Systems. The supplied functionality includes: json.k provides two way conversion between kdb+ data structures and JSON; u.q is the standard pub/sub functionality provided with kdb+tick, and a modified version is incorporated to publish data structures which can be easily interpreted in JavaScript; functions for reformatting temporal types to be JSON compliant; page serving to utilise the inbuilt kdb+ webserver to serve custom web pages. An example would be instead of having to serve a page with a hardcoded websocket connection host and port, the kdb+ process can serve a page connecting back to itself no matter which host or port it is running on. JavaScript Utilities The JavaScript utilities are contained in kdbconnect.js. The library allows you to: create a connection to the kdb+ process; display the socket status; sending queries; binding results returned from kdb+ to updates in the webpage. Outline All communication between websockets and kdb+ is asynchronous. The approach we have adopted is to ensure that all data sent to the web browser is encoded as a JSON object containing a tag to enable the web page to decipher what the data relates to. The format we have chosen is for kdb+ to send dictionaries of the form: `name`data!(\"dataID\";dataObject) All the packing can be done by .html.dataformat. Please note that the temporal types are converted to longs which can easily be converted to JavaScript Date types. This formatting can be modified in the formating dictionary .html.typemap. q)a:flip `minute`time`date`month`timestamp`timespan`datetime`float`sym!enlist each (09:00; 09:00:00.0;.z.d; `month$.z.d; .z.p; .z.n;.z.z;20f;`a) q).html.dataformat[\"start\";(enlist `tradegraph)!enlist a] name| \"start\" data| (,`tradegraph)!,+`minute`time`date`month`timestamp`timespan`datetime`float`sym!(,32400000;,32400000;,1396828800000;,1396310400000;,\"2014-04-07T13:23:01Z\";,48181023;,\"2014-04-07T13:23:01Z\";,20f;,`a) q)first (.html.dataformat[\"start\";(enlist `tradegraph)!enlist a])[`data;`tradegraph] minute | 32400000 time | 32400000 date | 1396828800000 month | 1396310400000 timestamp| \"2014-04-07T13:23:01Z\" timespan | 48181023 datetime | \"2014-04-07T13:23:01Z\" float | 20f sym | `a We have also extended this structure to allow web pages to receive data in a way similar to the standard kdb+tick pub/sub format.

Subscriptions are done using .html.wssub[`tablename] Publications from the kdb+ side are done with .html.pub[`tablename;tabledata] On the JavaScript side the incoming messages (data events) must be bound to page updates. For example, there might be an initialisation event called \u201cstart\u201d which allows the web page to retrieve all the initial data from the process. The code below redraws the areas of the page with the received data. /* Bind data - Data type \"start\" will execute the callback function */ KDBCONNECT.bind(\"data\",\"start\",function(data){ // Check that data is not empty if(data.hbtable.length !== 0) // Write HTML table to div element with id heartbeat-table { $(\"#heartbeat-table\").html(MONITOR.jsonTable(data.hbtable));} if(data.lmtable.length !== 0) // Write HTML table to div element with id logmsg-table { $(\"#logmsg-table\").html(MONITOR.jsonTable(data.lmtable));} if(data.lmchart.length !== 0) // Log message error chart { MONITOR.barChart(data.lmchart,\"logmsg-chart\",\"Error Count\",\"myTab\"); } }); Similarly the upd messages must be bound to page updates. In this case, the structure is slightly different: KDBCONNECT.bind(\"data\",\"upd\",function(data){ if(data.tabledata.length===0) return; if(data.tablename === \"heartbeat\") { $(\"#heartbeat-table\").html(MONITOR.jsonTable(data.tabledata));} if(data.tablename === \"logmsg\") { $(\"#logmsg-table\").html(MONITOR.jsonTable(data.tabledata));} if(data.tablename === \"lmchart\") { MONITOR.barChart(data.tabledata,\"logmsg-chart\",\"Error Count\",\"myTab\"); } }); To display the WebSocket connection status the event \u201cws_event\u201d must be bound and it will output one of these default messages: \u201cConnecting...\u201d, \u201cConnected\u201d and \u201cDisconnected\u201d depending on the connection state of the WebSocket. Alternatively the value of the readyState attribute will determine the WebSocket status. // Select html element using jQuery var $statusMsg = $(\"#status-msg\"); KDBCONNECT.bind(\"ws_event\",function(data){ // Data is the default message string $statusMsg.html(data); }); KDBCONNECT.core.websocket.readyState // Returns 1 if connected. Errors can be displayed by binding the event called \u201cerror\u201d. KDBCONNECT.bind(\"error\",function(data){ $statusMsg.html(\"Error - \" + data); }); Example A basic example is provided with the Monitor process. To get this to work, u.q from kdb+tick should be placed in the code/common directory to allow all processes to publish updates.

These utilise some community code, specifically json.k and a modified version of u.q, both from Kx Systems. The supplied functionality includes: json.k provides two way conversion between kdb+ data structures and JSON; u.q is the standard pub/sub functionality provided with kdb+tick, and a modified version is incorporated to publish data structures which can be easily interpreted in JavaScript; functions for reformatting temporal types to be JSON compliant; page serving to utilise the inbuilt kdb+ webserver to serve custom web pages. An example would be instead of having to serve a page with a hardcoded websocket connection host and port, the kdb+ process can serve a page connecting back to itself no matter which host or port it is running on.","title":"kdb+ Utilities"},{"location":"visualisation/#javascript-utilities","text":"The JavaScript utilities are contained in kdbconnect.js.

The approach we have adopted is to ensure that all data sent to the web browser is encoded as a JSON object containing a tag to enable the web page to decipher what the data relates to. The format we have chosen is for kdb+ to send dictionaries of the form: `name`data!(\"dataID\";dataObject) All the packing can be done by .html.dataformat. Please note that the temporal types are converted to longs which can easily be converted to JavaScript Date types.

In this case, the data object looks like: `name`data!(\"upd\";`tablename`tabledata!(`trade;([]time:09:00 09:05 09:10; price:12 13 14))) This can be packed with .html.updformat: q).html.updformat[\"upd\";`tablename`tabledata!(`trade;a)] name| \"upd\" data| `tablename`tabledata!(`trade;+`minute`time`date`month`timestamp`timespan`datetime`float`sym!(,32400000;,32400000;,1396828800000;,1396310400000;,\"2014-04-07T13:23:01Z\";,48181023;,\"2014-04-07T13:23:01Z\";,20f;,`a)) q)first(.html.updformat[\"upd\";`tablename`tabledata!(`trade;a)])[`data;`tabledata] minute | 32400000 time | 32400000 date | 1396828800000 month | 1396310400000 timestamp| \"2014-04-07T13:23:01Z\" timespan | 48181023 datetime | \"2014-04-07T13:23:01Z\" float | 20f sym | `a To utilise the pub/sub functionality, the web page must connect to the kdb+ process and subscribe for updates. Subscriptions are done using .html.wssub[`tablename] Publications from the kdb+ side are done with .html.pub[`tablename;tabledata] On the JavaScript side the incoming messages (data events) must be bound to page updates. For example, there might be an initialisation event called \u201cstart\u201d which allows the web page to retrieve all the initial data from the process. The code below redraws the areas of the page with the received data. /* Bind data - Data type \"start\" will execute the callback function */ KDBCONNECT.bind(\"data\",\"start\",function(data){ // Check that data is not empty if(data.hbtable.length !== 0) // Write HTML table to div element with id heartbeat-table { $(\"#heartbeat-table\").html(MONITOR.jsonTable(data.hbtable));} if(data.lmtable.length !== 0) // Write HTML table to div element with id logmsg-table { $(\"#logmsg-table\").html(MONITOR.jsonTable(data.lmtable));} if(data.lmchart.length !== 0) // Log message error chart { MONITOR.barChart(data.lmchart,\"logmsg-chart\",\"Error Count\",\"myTab\"); } }); Similarly the upd messages must be bound to page updates. In this case, the structure is slightly different: KDBCONNECT.bind(\"data\",\"upd\",function(data){ if(data.tabledata.length===0) return; if(data.tablename === \"heartbeat\") { $(\"#heartbeat-table\").html(MONITOR.jsonTable(data.tabledata));} if(data.tablename === \"logmsg\") { $(\"#logmsg-table\").html(MONITOR.jsonTable(data.tabledata));} if(data.tablename === \"lmchart\") { MONITOR.barChart(data.tabledata,\"logmsg-chart\",\"Error Count\",\"myTab\"); } }); To display the WebSocket connection status the event \u201cws_event\u201d must be bound and it will output one of these default messages: \u201cConnecting...\u201d, \u201cConnected\u201d and \u201cDisconnected\u201d depending on the connection state of the WebSocket. Alternatively the value of the readyState attribute will determine the WebSocket status. // Select html element using jQuery var $statusMsg = $(\"#status-msg\"); KDBCONNECT.bind(\"ws_event\",function(data){ // Data is the default message string $statusMsg.html(data); }); KDBCONNECT.core.websocket.readyState // Returns 1 if connected. Errors can be displayed by binding the event called \u201cerror\u201d. KDBCONNECT.bind(\"error\",function(data){ $statusMsg.html(\"Error - \" + data); });","title":"Outline"},{"location":"visualisation/#example","text":"A basic example is provided with the Monitor process.
