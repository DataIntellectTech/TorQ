[ Recovering Corrupt Tickerplant Logs ]( http://www.dataintellect.com/q/recovering-corrupt-tickerplant-logs/ )

Corrupt tickerplant logs are a curse that no one deserves but that doesn’t stop them from happening even to the best of us. However, all hope is not lost as it is possible to recover the good messages and discard the bad.
